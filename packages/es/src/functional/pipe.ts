/**
 * Pipes a value through a series of functions from left to right.
 * Each function receives the result of the previous function.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const addOne = (x: number) => x + 1
 * const double = (x: number) => x * 2
 * const addOneThenDouble = pipe(addOne, double)
 * addOneThenDouble(5) // => 12 (5 + 1 = 6, 6 * 2 = 12)
 * ```
