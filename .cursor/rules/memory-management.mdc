      # Memory Management System

      ## Purpose

      The memory management system provides persistent context for AI assistants across conversations through structured memory files in the `docs/memory/` directory. This system works in conjunction with the [AI-Assisted Agile Workflow](mdc:.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc) to maintain comprehensive project context.

      ## Memory File Types

      *(Note: `${variable_name}` and `[Title]` placeholders in templates should be filled in based on context.)*

      **Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation for vibe-tools commands, options, and usage scenarios.

      **Critical for**: Working with vibe-tools commands, automation, and integration tasks.

      ## Memory File Management

      ### Essential Memory Files Loading Protocol

      At the start of EVERY new conversation or task, you MUST load these essential memory files IN THIS ORDER:

      1. **[workflow-status.md](mdc:docs/memory/workflow-status.md)**: CRITICAL - Provides current state of all active tasks and projects
      2. **[architecture.md](mdc:docs/memory/architecture.md)**: REQUIRED - Contains system architecture and component relationships
      3. **[user-preferences.md](mdc:docs/memory/user-preferences.md)**: REQUIRED - Details preferences for code style, tools, and workflows
      4. **[domain-knowledge.md](mdc:docs/memory/domain-knowledge.md)**: REQUIRED - Contains domain-specific concepts and terminology
      5. **[decisions.md](mdc:docs/memory/decisions.md)**: REQUIRED - Record of key technical decisions

      This context loading is MANDATORY, not optional, to ensure you have sufficient context to follow the [AI-Assisted Agile Workflow](mdc:.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc) accurately and provide consistent assistance.

      **Additional memory files** may be loaded after these essential files based on the specific task or context:
      - **[vibe-tools-playbook.md](mdc:docs/memory/vibe-tools-playbook.md)**: Load when working with vibe-tools commands, automation, or integration tasks

      ### Memory File Creation and Update Guidelines

      #### Core Update Principles

      1. **Structure Consistency**: Follow the established templates
         - Use consistent headers and formatting
         - Maintain the same section order across updates
         - Include all required sections for the file type

      2. **Section Management**: Follow these critical protocols
         - **Always search for existing sections before adding new ones**
         - **Merge content into existing sections rather than creating duplicates**
         - **Keep the "## Updated: YYYY-MM-DD" line as the very last line in the file**
         - Use the current date obtained following [date-consistency-enforcer](mdc:.cursor/rules/date-consistency-enforcer.mdc) (prioritize `mcp_time_get_current_time` tool, fallback to `date +%Y-%m-%d`) for the timestamp
         - There should only be ONE "## Updated: YYYY-MM-DD" line per file

      3. **Content Merging Strategies**:
         - **For lists**: Add new items to the existing list in appropriate order
         - **For tables**: Add new rows to existing tables, don't create duplicate tables
         - **For narrative text**: Update existing paragraphs or add new ones
         - **For code blocks**: Update existing blocks or add new ones with clear comments

      4. **Critical Error Prevention**:
         - **NEVER add a duplicate section with the same name** - search for existing sections first
         - **NEVER have multiple timestamp lines** - there should be only one "## Updated:" line
         - **NEVER leave the timestamp in the middle of the file** - it must be the very last line
         - **NEVER overwrite existing content** - merge or append appropriately

      5. **Cross-Reference Management**: Include links to other related memory files
         - Use relative paths (e.g., `/docs/memory/workflow-status.md`)
         - Maintain cross-references between related memory files

      #### Memory File Update Process

      When updating a memory file, follow this structured process:

      1. **Read the entire file** first to understand its structure and content
      2. **Identify sections to update** based on new information
      3. **Search for each section name** (using Ctrl+F/Cmd+F) before adding content
      4. **Merge new content into existing sections** rather than creating duplicates
      5. **Add entirely new sections only if they don't already exist**
      6. **Update the timestamp** at the end of the file using today's date
      7. **Review the file** to ensure no duplicate sections were created
      8. **Save the file** only after confirming proper structure

      #### File Structure Validation

      To maintain the integrity of memory files:

      ```markdown
      # Correct ✓
      ## Section A
      Content for section A

      ## Section B
      Content for section B

      ## Updated: 2025-05-22
      ```

      ```markdown
      # Incorrect ❌
      ## Section A
      Content for section A

      ## Section B
      Content for section B

      ## Updated: 2025-05-01

      ## Section A
      New content for section A

      ## Updated: 2025-05-22
      ```

      ## Memory Update Processes

      ### Task Completion Integration

      The memory management system integrates directly with the [AI-Assisted Agile Workflow](mdc:.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc) to automatically capture and retain knowledge from completed tasks.

      #### Triggering Memory Updates on Task Completion

      Memory updates are automatically triggered when:

      1. **Task completion is indicated by**:
         - Messages containing: `(?i)(task completed|finished implementing|done with|completed task|task is done|fixed issue|implemented|resolved|finished|done)`
         - Content containing `Status: Completed` in task files
         - Task files moved to the `docs/tasks/done/` directory

      2. **Explicit update request**:
         - Messages containing: `(?i)(update memory files|refresh memory files|update memory|synchronize memory files)`

      #### Task Completion Memory Update Process

      When a task completion trigger is detected, you MUST perform the following steps:

      1. **Extract Task Information**:
         - Task type (e.g., Feature Implementation, Bug Fix, Configuration)
         - Core components affected
         - Problem solved or objective achieved
         - Solution implemented
         - Key learnings and insights gained

      2. **Update Memory Files**:
         - **`docs/memory/workflow-status.md`**: Mark the completed task as "Completed" in the Task History table, and update the "Current State" section following the structural guidelines above
         - **`docs/memory/domain-knowledge.md`**: Add new insights, implementation patterns, or technical decisions derived from the task to relevant sections (e.g., "Implementation Patterns", "Technical Decisions") while adhering to the Section Merging Guidelines
         - **Task-Specific Memory File** (Optional): Detailed implementation notes might be added to a dedicated file (e.g., `docs/memory/tasks/YYYY-MM-DD-XX.md`) following Creating or Updating Memory Files guidelines and appropriate templates from the `docs/templates/` directory

      #### Memory Update Process for Direct User Requests

      > **IMPORTANT: THIS SECTION IS AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGERED WHEN PHRASES LIKE "update memory files", "refresh memory files", "update memory", or "synchronize memory files" ARE DETECTED!**
      >
      > When these trigger phrases are detected, you MUST immediately execute this process to ensure memory files remain updated and consistent across all sessions.

      When directly requested to update memory files (via "update memory files" or similar trigger phrases):

      1. **Assess Update Scope**:
         - **Required Files**: ALWAYS update `workflow-status.md` AND `features.md`
         - **Context**: Review recent updates in workflow-status.md to determine what's changed

      2. **Critical Update Principles**:
         - **Start with Audit Trail**: First add entry to Recent Updates in workflow-status.md
           ```
           "- Updated memory files to reflect current project status. (YYYY-MM-DD)"
           ```
         - **Feature Updates**: ONLY update ACTIVE features identified in workflow-status.md
           - Features must be updated but only those with actual progress since last update
           - Verify active features via "Current Task", "Next Task", and "Recent Updates" in workflow-status.md
           - Never update timestamps for inactive or unchanged features
         - **Timestamps**: Update bottom timestamp on all modified files

      3. **Implementation Steps**:
         - Get current date via `mcp_time_get_current_time`
         - Update workflow-status.md first
         - For features.md, follow template at `docs/templates/features-template.md`
         - Apply all Section Merging Guidelines from above
         - Verify consistency across all updated files

      ### Best Practices for Memory File Updates

      ALWAYS adhere to these principles (which align with general memory management best practices):

      1. **Specificity**: Ensure extracted task information is detailed and accurate
      2. **Contextualization**: Document the "why" behind the changes, not just the "what"
      3. **Connectivity**: Link new knowledge to existing concepts in memory files
      4. **Lessons Learned**: Capture any significant challenges, solutions, or alternatives considered
      5. **Cross-Reference Updates**: Maintain links between related memory files

      This update process integrates seamlessly with the overall [AI-Assisted Agile Workflow](mdc:.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc) to maintain a continuously improving knowledge base.

      ## Sequential Thinking for Memory Management

      When managing memory files (reading, updating, or creating), and instructions refer to 'Sequential Thinking', a 'step-by-step approach', or 'structured reasoning', this indicates the use of the **`mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking`** tool. This tool is essential for thorough analysis, context integration, consistency checking, and ensuring comprehensive updates to memory files.

      When reading, updating, or creating memory files, you MUST use the **`mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking`** tool to ensure:

      1. **Thorough Analysis**: Carefully examine existing content before making changes
      2. **Context Integration**: Connect new information with existing knowledge
      3. **Consistency Checking**: Verify that updates maintain consistency across all memory files
      4. **Comprehensive Updates**: Ensure all relevant sections are updated appropriately
      5. **Long-term Context Retention**: Preserve important information for future sessions

      For complex memory operations like merging duplicate sections or resolving conflicts, the step-by-step reasoning provided by **`mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking`** tool is essential for maintaining memory integrity.

      When you see instructions to "Use Sequential Thinking," this means you should either:
      1. Use the `mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking` tool when available, OR
      2. Structure your response with explicitly numbered thought steps, showing your reasoning process

examples:
  - input: |
      Can you tell me about the current state of the project?
    output: |
      I'll check the memory files to understand the current project state.

      Based on the [workflow status memory file](/docs/memory/workflow-status.md), here's what I can tell you:

      **Current Project**: Cursor Rules System Improvement
      **Current Phase**: Implementation Phase 1
      **Active Task**: Create a relationship diagram for all rules (Task ID: 2025-04-25-01)
      **Next Task**: Define standard linking format (Task ID: 2025-04-25-02)

      The project is implementing a hierarchical rule structure with cross-references. The goal is to transform rules from independent documents into a navigable, interconnected knowledge system.

      Recent updates include:
      - Moving documentation from reference/ to docs/
      - Renaming "recommendations" to "features" to better align with agile methodology
      - Creating various templates for tasks, plans, and features
      - Setting up the memory management system

      Would you like more specific information about the current task, the overall plan, or another aspect of the project? (Information sourced from [workflow-status.md](/docs/memory/workflow-status.md))

  - input: |
      I need you to memorize this API endpoint for future reference.
    output: |
      To store an API endpoint for future reference, I recommend documenting it in your code, comments, or a dedicated API reference document rather than relying on memory files.

      You could add it to:

      1. Your code as a constant:
      ```typescript
      export const API_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.example.com/v1/resource';
      ```

      2. A dedicated API reference file:
      ```markdown
      # API References

      ## External APIs
      - Example API: `https://api.example.com/v1/resource`
      ```

      3. Environment variables or configuration files.

      This approach keeps API references with your project code rather than in memory management files, which are primarily used for context retention across AI conversations. Would you like me to add this API endpoint to your code or a dedicated API reference file?
