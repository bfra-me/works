      ## Introduction: What Are Cursor Rules?
      Cursor rules are specialized markdown documents (`.mdc` files) that provide conditional context to AI assistants in the Cursor IDE. They are **not** application features, code, or processes requiring testing or metrics. Their sole purpose is to enhance AI conversations by supplying relevant contextual knowledge at the right moment. Treat them as documentation/prompt engineering artifacts.

      For more, see the [rule index](mdc:.cursor/rules/00-rule-index.mdc) and [domain knowledge](mdc:docs/memory/domain-knowledge.md).

      ---
      ## Step-by-Step Rule Creation Process
      1. **Identify the Need**: What guidance is missing? Check the [rule index](mdc:.cursor/rules/00-rule-index.mdc) to avoid duplication.
      2. **Define the Scope**: What files, patterns, or contexts should trigger the rule?
      3. **Choose the Application Type**: See "Rule Application Types" below.
      4. **Plan the Structure**: Outline the main sections (see templates below).
      5. **Create the Rule File**: Place it in `.cursor/rules/` using kebab-case (e.g., `typescript-patterns.mdc`).
      6. **Add Frontmatter**: See "Frontmatter Explained" below.
      7. **Write the Rule Content**: Use the template for your rule type. Include actionable guidance, examples, and cross-references.
      8. **Add Metadata**: At the end of the `<rule>` block, add a metadata section (see below).
      9. **Test the Rule**: Open relevant files and queries to ensure the rule triggers as intended.
      10. **Update the Rule Index**: Add or update the entry in [00-rule-index.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/00-rule-index.mdc).
      11. **Review and Iterate**: Get feedback and refine as needed.

      ---
      ## Rule Application Types
      Cursor rules can be activated in four ways. Choose the most appropriate type:

      1. **Auto-Attached**: Activated by file patterns (e.g., `*.ts`). Use for file-type or language-specific guidance.
      2. **Agent-Requested**: Activated by AI when relevant to the conversation. Use for workflows, processes, or general guidance.
      3. **Always-Applied**: Active in all conversations. Use sparingly for universal standards.
      4. **Manual**: Only included when explicitly requested. Use for highly specialized or rare guidance.

      See [Rule Application Types](mdc:docs/memory/rule-application-types.md) for detailed definitions, configuration, best practices, and a decision flow chart.

      ---
      ## Rule File Location and Naming

      1.  **Directory**: All Cursor rule files (`.mdc`) MUST reside exclusively in the `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/` directory.
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```
      2.  **Naming Convention**:
         *   Use **kebab-case** for filenames (e.g., `my-new-rule.mdc`).
         *   The extension MUST be `.mdc`.
         *   Choose names that are descriptive of the rule's purpose.
      3.  **Incorrect Locations**: Never place rule files in the project root, other subdirectories, or anywhere outside `.cursor/rules/`.

      ---
      ## Frontmatter Explained
      Every rule must start with YAML frontmatter:
      ```yaml
      ---
      description: ACTION when TRIGGER to OUTCOME
      globs: pattern1, pattern2 # For auto-attached rules
      alwaysApply: [true|false]
      ---
      ```
      - **description**: Use the "VERB when CONTEXT to OUTCOME" pattern. Approved verbs: FOLLOW, APPLY, USE, ALWAYS USE. See [description standardization](mdc:docs/memory/cursor-rule-descriptions.md).
      - **globs**: Comma-separated file patterns for auto-attached rules. Omit for agent-requested/manual/always-applied unless needed.
      - **alwaysApply**: `true` for always-applied, `false` otherwise.
      - **Editing**: Use terminal commands or `sed` for reliable editing. See [frontmatter guidelines](mdc:docs/memory/cursor-rule-frontmatter.md).

      ---
      ## Rule Content Structure
      After frontmatter, include:
      1. **Title**: Main heading for the rule
      2. **<rule> Block**: Contains:
         - `name`: Unique snake_case identifier
         - `description`: Brief summary (do not duplicate frontmatter)
         - `filters`: When the rule applies
         - `actions`: What happens when triggered
         - `examples`: Sample interactions
         - `metadata`: See below
      3. **Related Rules**: (Optional) List with `mdc:` links

      </rule>
      ```

      ---
      ## Best Practices for Rule Creation
      - Use the approved description pattern and verbs.
      - Be specific and actionable in guidance.
      - Include at least one realistic example.
      - Use cross-references to related rules/files with `mdc:` syntax.
      - Keep rules focused on a single topic.
      - Test glob patterns and filters for correct activation.
      - Use terminal commands for frontmatter edits.
      - Update the rule index after changes.
      - Review and update rules regularly.
      - See [user preferences](mdc:docs/memory/user-preferences.md) for more.

      ---
      ## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
      - **Misconfigured frontmatter**: Use the correct pattern and field names.
      - **Vague or generic descriptions**: Use the approved pattern and be specific.
      - **Missing or poor examples**: Always include at least one clear example.
      - **Improper file placement**: All rules must be in `.cursor/rules/`.
      - **Quoted glob patterns**: Use unquoted patterns (e.g., `globs: *.ts` not `globs: "*.ts"`).
      - **Forgetting to update the rule index**: Always update [00-rule-index.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/00-rule-index.mdc).
      - **Not testing rule activation**: Open relevant files and queries to verify.
      - **Not using `mdc:` links**: All cross-references must use `mdc:` syntax.
      - **Neglecting version metadata**: Always update the version and changelog.

      ---
      ## Writing Effective Rule Descriptions
      - Use the "VERB when CONTEXT to OUTCOME" pattern.
      - Approved verbs: FOLLOW, APPLY, USE, ALWAYS USE.
      - The description must be in the frontmatter, not duplicated in the `<rule>` block.
      - See [description standardization](mdc:docs/memory/cursor-rule-descriptions.md) for more.

      ---
      ## Cross-References and Linking (`mdc:` Syntax)

      Proper linking is essential for navigation and context within the Cursor IDE.

      1.  **Required Syntax**: When linking to **any file** (other rules, documentation, source code, etc.) from within a Cursor rule file (`.mdc`), you MUST use the `mdc:` syntax:
         ```markdown
         [display text](mdc:path/to/filename.ext)
         ```
         *   Replace `[display text]` with descriptive link text.
         *   Replace `path/to/filename.ext` with the correct path relative to the project root.
         *   Vanilla Markdown links (`[text](path)`) will **not** work correctly.

      2.  **Linking to Other Rules**: Use the rule's filename:
         ```markdown
         See the [typescript-patterns](mdc:.cursor/rules/typescript-patterns.mdc) rule for coding standards.
         ```
         This will render as `@typescript-patterns` in the IDE.

      3.  **Linking to Non-Rule Files**: Use the file's path:
         ```markdown
         Refer to the [main plan document](mdc:docs/plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md).
         Consult the [user preferences](mdc:docs/memory/user-preferences.md).
         ```

      4.  **When to Link**:
         *   Referring to concepts defined in other files.
         *   Pointing to templates, examples, or related documentation.
         *   Describing workflows spanning multiple files.
         *   Indicating dependencies or complementary relationships between rules.
         *   In the "Related Rules" section.

      5.  **Updating Links**: Keep links accurate, especially if files are renamed or moved. Search for old link patterns (like `{rule:name}`) and update them to the `mdc:` format.

      ---
      ## Versioning and Metadata
      - Add a `metadata` block at the end of the `<rule>` element.
      - Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
      - **priority**: Indicates rule importance (high, medium, low).
      - **tags**: Keywords for categorization and search.
      - **changelog**: Track changes across versions.

      ---
      ## Updating Existing Rules

      When modifying existing rules, follow these steps:
      1. Update the content as needed
      2. Increment the `version` in the metadata according to semantic versioning
      3. Add an entry to the `changelog` detailing the changes
      4. Update the `last_updated` date in the metadata
      5. If the rule's description or category changes, update the [00-rule-index](mdc:.cursor/rules/00-rule-index.mdc)

      ## Rule Prioritization and Conflict Resolution

      When multiple Cursor rules could potentially apply to a given context (e.g., multiple rules have matching `filters`), a prioritization system determines which rule's guidance is presented or considered most relevant by the AI assistant. The goal is to surface the most specific and pertinent context.

      The priority is determined by the following hierarchy, evaluated in order:

      1.  **Explicit User Invocation**: If the user explicitly requests a specific rule (e.g., by mentioning its name or linking to it), that rule takes the highest priority for that specific interaction, overriding other potential matches.

      2.  **`alwaysApply: true` Rules**: Rules configured with `alwaysApply: true` are always considered active but generally provide foundational context (like cross-reference syntax) rather than specific task guidance. They don't usually conflict directly with context-specific rules but are always available.

      3.  **Activation Specificity (Filters)**: The primary factor for prioritization among context-dependent rules (`alwaysApply: false`) is the specificity of the filter that triggered the activation. More specific matches take precedence over general matches.
          *   **Highest Specificity**: Exact file path match (`type: file_path` with a full path).
          *   **High Specificity**: Glob pattern match (`type: file_path` with `globs`). A more specific glob (e.g., `packages/feature/specific.ts`) takes precedence over a broader glob (e.g., `packages/**/*.ts`).
          *   **Medium Specificity**: File extension match (`type: file_extension`).
          *   **Lower Specificity**: Content match (`type: content`). A longer, more specific content pattern may take precedence over a short, generic one.
          *   **Lowest Specificity**: Message pattern match (`type: message`). Usually triggers broader workflow or process rules.
          *   **Event-based triggers** (`type: event`): Priority depends on the event's nature and associated context.

      4.  **Metadata `priority` Field**: If multiple rules have the *same level of activation specificity*, the `priority` field in the rule's metadata (`high`, `medium`, `low`) acts as a tie-breaker.
          *   `high` priority rules take precedence over `medium` and `low`.
          *   `medium` priority rules take precedence over `low`.
          *   If rules have the same specificity and the same `priority` metadata (or no priority set), the AI may present options or use its judgment based on the conversational context.

      5.  **AI Judgment**: Ultimately, the AI assistant uses this hierarchy along with the conversational context to determine the most relevant rule(s) to apply or suggest. It might synthesize information from multiple relevant rules if they are complementary rather than conflicting.

      ### Examples of Conflict Resolution

      *   **Scenario 1**: User is editing `packages/eslint-config/src/index.ts`.
          *   Rule A: `filter: { type: file_path, globs: ["packages/eslint-config/**/*.ts"] }` (High Specificity Glob)
          *   Rule B: `filter: { type: file_extension, pattern: "\\.ts$" }` (Medium Specificity Extension)
          *   **Outcome**: Rule A takes priority due to the more specific glob pattern.

      *   **Scenario 2**: User message contains "update eslint config".
          *   Rule C: `filter: { type: message, pattern: "(?i)eslint" }`, `priority: medium` (Low Specificity Message)
          *   Rule D: `filter: { type: message, pattern: "(?i)update eslint config" }`, `priority: medium` (Low Specificity Message, but more specific pattern)
          *   **Outcome**: Rule D likely takes priority due to the more specific message pattern, even though metadata priority is the same.

      *   **Scenario 3**: User is editing `readme.md`.
          *   Rule E: `filter: { type: file_extension, pattern: "\\.md$" }`, `priority: medium`
          *   Rule F: `filter: { type: file_extension, pattern: "\\.md$" }`, `priority: high`
          *   **Outcome**: Rule F takes priority because although the activation specificity is identical (file extension), its metadata priority is higher.

      ### Documenting Priority

      *   When creating rules, carefully consider the `filters` to ensure they activate in the appropriate context with the desired level of specificity.
      *   Use the `priority` metadata field primarily as a tie-breaker for rules with similar activation conditions. Assign `high`, `medium`, or `low` based on the rule's importance relative to other potentially conflicting rules. Most rules can likely remain at `medium` or have no explicit priority set.

      This prioritization system helps ensure that AI assistants receive the most relevant guidance, leading to more accurate and helpful responses. For more detailed strategies on handling conflicts, see [Conflict Resolution Guidance](mdc:docs/memory/rule-conflict-resolution.md).
