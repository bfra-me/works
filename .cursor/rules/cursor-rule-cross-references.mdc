      # File Links and Cross-References in Cursor Rules

      When creating links to any files (including other rules) from within a Cursor rule file, always use the proper `mdc:` syntax to ensure correct display and navigation within the Cursor IDE.

      ## General Linking Syntax

      The `mdc:` syntax is required for ALL file links from within a Cursor rule (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`). The general format is:

      ```markdown
      [display text](mdc:path/to/filename.ext)
      ```

      This applies to:
      - Links to other Cursor rules
      - Links to any file in the repository
      - Links to documentation
      - Links to any other file type

      ## Linking to Other Cursor Rules

      When linking to another Cursor rule, use:

      ```markdown
      [rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc)
      ```

      This will display in the Cursor IDE as:

      ```
      @rule-name
      ```

      ## Linking to Other Repository Files

      When linking to a non-rule file in the repository, use:

      ```markdown
      [filename](mdc:path/to/filename.ext)
      ```

      For example:

      ```markdown
      See [features.md](mdc:docs/features.md) for a list of features.
      ```

      ## Examples

      ### ✅ Correct Link Syntax

      ```markdown
      # Links to other rules
      For more information on TypeScript patterns, see [typescript-patterns](mdc:.cursor/rules/typescript-patterns.mdc).

      # Links to documentation files
      See the [features document](mdc:docs/features.md) for a list of all features.

      # Links to templates
      Use the [task template](mdc:docs/templates/task-template.md) when creating new tasks.
      ```

      ### ❌ Incorrect Link Formats (Avoid These)

      ```markdown
      # Don't use these formats:

      # For rule references
      See {rule:typescript-patterns} for more information.
      See @typescript-patterns for more information.

      # Regular markdown links without mdc: prefix
      See [features.md](docs/features.md) for a list of features.
      ```

      ## Related Rules Section

      Include a "Related Rules" section in your Cursor rules to help users and AI assistants discover related guidance:

      ```markdown
      ## Related Rules

      - [eslint-config-usage](mdc:.cursor/rules/eslint-config-usage.mdc) - For ESLint configuration
      - [prettier-config-usage](mdc:.cursor/rules/prettier-config-usage.mdc) - For Prettier formatting
      ```

      ## When to Add Links

      Add file links and cross-references:
      - When referring to concepts defined in other files
      - When pointing to templates or examples
      - When describing a workflow that spans multiple files
      - When rules or files complement or depend on each other
      - In a dedicated "Related Rules" section

      ## Important Notes

      1. The `mdc:` syntax is **required for ALL file links** from within a Cursor rule file (*.mdc)
      2. Always provide descriptive text in the link brackets
      3. Use the appropriate path to the file relative to the project root
      4. Keep cross-references up to date when files are renamed
      5. Vanilla Markdown links without the `mdc:` prefix will not work correctly in Cursor rules

      ## Updating Existing References

      When updating existing references:
      1. Search for patterns like `{rule:rule-name}` or non-`mdc:` links (`[file](path/to/file)`)
      2. Replace with the correct `[text](mdc:path/to/file)` format
      3. Verify the links work correctly in the Cursor IDE

examples:
  - input: |
      I want to reference the typescript-patterns rule in my Cursor rule.
    output: |
      To properly reference the typescript-patterns rule in your Cursor rule, use this syntax:

      ```markdown
      For TypeScript best practices, refer to [typescript-patterns](mdc:.cursor/rules/typescript-patterns.mdc).
      ```

      This will display as "@typescript-patterns" in the Cursor IDE and allow for proper navigation between rules.

      Remember that this `mdc:` syntax is required for all file links in Cursor rule files (*.mdc), not just for rule references.

  - input: |
      How do I link to a non-rule file like features.md from within my Cursor rule?
    output: |
      To link to a non-rule file like features.md from within your Cursor rule, you still need to use the `mdc:` syntax:

      ```markdown
      For more information about our project features, see the [features document](mdc:docs/features.md).
      ```

      The `mdc:` prefix is required for ALL file links within a Cursor rule file, not just for cross-references to other rules. This ensures proper navigation and display within the Cursor IDE.

      Remember to use the appropriate path to the file relative to the project root.

  - input: |
      How do I create a "Related Rules" section in my Cursor rule?
    output: |
      To create a "Related Rules" section in your Cursor rule:

      ```markdown
      ## Related Rules

      - [eslint-config-usage](mdc:.cursor/rules/eslint-config-usage.mdc) - For ESLint configuration with TypeScript
      - [prettier-config-usage](mdc:.cursor/rules/prettier-config-usage.mdc) - For code formatting standards
      - [development-workflow](mdc:.cursor/rules/development-workflow.mdc) - For the overall development process
      ```

      This section should typically appear toward the end of your rule, before examples or metadata sections. For each related rule, provide a brief description of why it's relevant or how it relates to the current rule.

      Remember that the `mdc:` prefix is required for all file links in Cursor rule files, including in the Related Rules section.
