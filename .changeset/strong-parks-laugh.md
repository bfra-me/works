Enhance preset discovery and versioning.

- Introduce a new module for preset discovery and installation, enabling users to find and manage semantic-release presets from various sources (npm, local, git, inline).
- Implement preset versioning utilities to manage preset versions, detect compatibility, and facilitate migrations between versions.
- Enhance existing presets with new options for changesets integration and improved release notes generation.
