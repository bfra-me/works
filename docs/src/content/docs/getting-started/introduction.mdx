## Why bfra.me Works?

### Consistency Across Projects
All configurations are designed to work together, ensuring consistent code style and quality across your entire project portfolio.

### Opinionated Defaults
Spend less time configuring and more time building. Each package comes with sensible defaults that work out of the box.

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript
Built for contemporary development practices with full ES module support and strict TypeScript configurations.

### Extensible Architecture
While opinionated, each package is designed to be easily customized and extended for your specific needs.

## Design Philosophy

bfra.me Works is built around these core principles:

- **Zero Config**: Works immediately without configuration
- **Composable**: Use individual packages or the complete toolkit
- **Maintainable**: Consistent patterns reduce cognitive load
- **Performance**: Optimized for both development and build performance
- **Community**: Built on established, well-maintained dependencies
