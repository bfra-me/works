# bfra.me/works Development Plan

This document serves as the hub for all development planning in the bfra.me/works repository.

## Active Projects

### Project 1: Cursor Rules System Improvement

**Objective**: Enhance the Cursor rules system to create a more effective AI-assisted development workflow.

**Status**: In Progress

**Current Phase**: Implementation Phase 1

**Active Tasks**:

## Planning Notes

- The next steps for Cursor Rules System Improvement will be to finalize the relationship diagram and propose the standard linking format
- Memory management system implementation has begun with the creation of the memory management rule
- We need to develop a mechanism for tracking completed tasks and updating the plan automatically
- Documentation has been moved from `reference/` to `docs/` for better organization

## Development Process

1. Tasks are derived from plans
2. Plans are created to address features
3. Features are tracked in the features document
4. This plan document provides an overview of all ongoing work
5. AI assistants maintain a workflow status memory file in `docs/memory/workflow-status.md`

## Workflow Status

- **Current Workflow**: AI-Assisted Agile Workflow
- **Last Updated**: 2025-04-25
- **Update Frequency**: Weekly
