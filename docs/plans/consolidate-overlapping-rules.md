# Plan: Consolidate Overlapping Rules and Eliminate Fragmentation

## Overview

This plan outlines the approach for consolidating overlapping Cursor rules into cohesive, comprehensive units organized by functional purpose rather than by individual topics. This will reduce duplication, improve maintainability, and create a more consistent experience for users and AI assistants.

## Success Criteria

- Reduced number of rules from 12 to approximately 7-8 more comprehensive rules
- Elimination of duplication and inconsistencies
- Clearer mental models of related processes
- Improved maintainability with fewer files to update
- Better context by showing related concepts together
- Consistent formatting and structure across all rules

     - Unified workflow connecting all aspects of rule management
     - Preservation of all critical guidance from source rules
     - Proper frontmatter configuration:
       ```
       ---
       description: Comprehensive guide for creating, placing, and managing Cursor rules
       globs: *.mdc
       alwaysApply: false
       ---
       ```

2. Create unified code standards rule
