# Plan: Implement Memory Management System

## Overview

This plan outlines the approach for creating a comprehensive memory management system using memory files to maintain context across conversations. The system will allow AI assistants to persist important information, track project status, and maintain a consistent understanding of the codebase and development workflow, enhancing their effectiveness through improved context awareness.

     - Guidelines for maintaining and updating memory files
     - Integration with existing markdown documentation
     - Templates for architecture, user preferences, and domain knowledge
     - Templates include standardized sections and guidance on maintenance

3. Define memory update workflow
   - **Complexity**: Medium
   - **Dependencies**: Tasks 1, 2
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Clear process for when and how to update memory files
     - Identification of update trigger points
     - Guidelines for conflict resolution
     - Documentation of memory file lifecycle
     - Integration with existing workflows
     - Template for workflow status with current state, task history, context, and updates
     - Integration with the agile workflow rule

### Phase 2: Memory Management Rule Development (1-2 weeks)

**Objective**: Create a Cursor rule for memory management

**Tasks**:

1. Create memory management rule
   - **Complexity**: High
   - **Dependencies**: Phases 1, 2
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Creation of "memory-management.mdc" covering:
       - When and how to create memory entries
       - How to update existing memory
       - How to query memory for context
       - Memory persistence best practices
     - Examples of proper memory management
     - Integration with existing workflows
     - Proper frontmatter configuration:
       ```
       ---
       description: Guidelines for maintaining persistent memory across conversations
       globs: docs/memory/*.md
       alwaysApply: true
       ---
       ```
     - Cross-references to related rules
     - Rule defines key memory file types with templates for each

2. Create memory update protocols
   - **Complexity**: Medium
   - **Dependencies**: Task 1 (Phase 3)
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Clear protocols for different types of memory updates
     - Standardized update formats
     - Examples of proper updates

     - AI assistants can retrieve information from memory files
     - Information remains consistent across conversations
     - Context is maintained between sessions
     - Entities and relationships are properly maintained
     - Information can be retrieved from both memory files

3. Conduct user testing and finalize system
   - **Complexity**: Medium
   - **Dependencies**: Task 2 (Phase 4)
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - User testing sessions with AI interaction
     - Collection of feedback on memory effectiveness
     - Measurement of context retention improvements
     - Documentation of user experience
     - Implementation of high-priority feedback
     - Revisions based on testing and feedback

     - Comprehensive examples of memory usage
     - Sign-off on memory system quality
     - Training material for AI users

## Maintenance Considerations

### Regular Memory Audits

- Establish process for regular memory audits
- Create procedures for cleaning up outdated information
- Define retention policies for different memory types
- Document archiving procedures
- Implement monitoring for memory health

### Error Handling

- Create procedures for handling memory inconsistencies
- Develop recovery methods for corrupted memory
- Establish fallback strategies when memory is unavailable
- Document common memory-related issues and solutions
- Define escalation procedures for critical memory failures

### Continuous Improvement

- Establish feedback loop for memory system improvements
- Create metrics for measuring memory effectiveness
- Schedule regular reviews of memory usage patterns
- Document best practices discovered through usage
- Implement enhancement process based on user needs

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 2 weeks (original estimate: 1 week)
- Phase 2: 2 weeks (new phase in consolidated plan)
