# Plan: Cursor Rules System Improvements

## Overview

A comprehensive plan to enhance the cursor rules system by improving organization, standardizing structure, optimizing content, and managing conflicts. This plan focuses on treating Cursor rules as what they truly are: specialized markdown documents providing conditional context to AI assistants, not application features requiring traditional development practices.

## Success Criteria

- Complete rule index with categorized rules and clear navigation
- Version control implemented across all rules with consistent metadata
- Standardized format and structure across all rules
- Reduced redundancy through rule consolidation
- Clear conflict resolution guidance and rule priority system
- Improved rule specificity with better activation conditions
- Enhanced documentation and examples
- Standardized rule application types (auto-attached, agent requested, etc.)
- Improved cross-referencing between rules

- Access to all cursor rules
- Documentation on current rule usage patterns
- Examples of rule conflicts and overlaps
- Understanding of AI assistant behavior with rules

## Progress Status

This plan is currently transitioning from Phase 1 to Phase 2. All Phase 1 tasks have been completed:
- Created a comprehensive rule index file (00-rule-index.mdc) with rules categorized by their purpose
- Added version control metadata to all rules following a consistent pattern
- Established standards for rule versioning with semantic versioning
- Completed updates for all remaining rules that were missing metadata

Phase 2 will focus on structural standardization of all rules to ensure a consistent format, followed by content optimization and rule interaction management.
