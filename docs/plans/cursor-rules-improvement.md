- Version control implemented across all rules with consistent metadata
- Standardized format and structure across all rules
- Reduced redundancy through rule consolidation
- Clear conflict resolution guidance and rule priority system
- Improved rule specificity with better regex patterns and examples

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Work

**Objective**: Establish core infrastructure for rule management and versioning

**Tasks**:

1. Create comprehensive rule index
   - **Complexity**: Medium
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: Completed
   - **Completion Date**: 2025-05-02
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - All rules categorized and listed
     - Quick reference links
     - Clear descriptions
     - Priority indicators

2. Add version control for rules

   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Version metadata in all rules
     - Changelog sections added
     - Consistent version numbering
     - Historical versions documented

### Phase 2: Structural Standardization

**Objective**: Ensure consistent format and structure across all rules

**Tasks**:

1. Create rule format template
   - **Complexity**: Medium

   - **Status**: Not Started
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - All rules follow template
     - No formatting inconsistencies
     - Updated examples
     - Verified metadata

### Phase 3: Content Optimization

**Objective**: Improve rule content quality and reduce redundancy

**Tasks**:

1. Consolidate overlapping rules
   - **Complexity**: High
   - **Dependencies**: Phase 2 completion
   - **Status**: Not Started
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Identified overlapping content
     - Merged redundant rules
     - Updated cross-references
     - Preserved all functionality

2. Improve rule specificity
   - **Complexity**: High
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Status**: Not Started
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Refined regex patterns
     - Better examples
     - Clear trigger conditions
     - Reduced false positives

### Phase 4: Conflict Management

**Objective**: Establish clear guidelines for rule application and conflict resolution

**Tasks**:

1. Add conflict resolution guidance
   - **Complexity**: High
   - **Dependencies**: Phase 3 completion
   - **Status**: Not Started
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Conflict identification guide
     - Resolution strategies
     - Example scenarios
     - Decision flowcharts

2. Prioritize rule application
   - **Complexity**: Medium
   - **Dependencies**: Conflict resolution guidance
   - **Status**: Not Started
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Priority levels defined
     - Rule hierarchy established
     - Override conditions documented
     - Clear application order

## Timeline

- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 1 week
- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 1 week

Total estimated time: 5 weeks

## Resources Required

- Access to all cursor rules
- Documentation on current rule usage patterns
- Examples of rule conflicts and overlaps
- Test environment for rule validation

## Progress Status

This plan is currently in Phase 1: Foundation Work. All Phase 1 tasks have been completed:
- Created a comprehensive rule index file (00-rule-index.mdc) with rules categorized by their purpose
- Added version control metadata to all rules following a consistent pattern
- Established standards for rule versioning with semantic versioning
- Completed updates for all remaining rules that were missing metadata

The next phase will focus on structural standardization of all rules to ensure a consistent format and user experience.
