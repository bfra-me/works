# Plan: Develop Rules for Missing Critical Workflows

## Overview

This plan outlines the approach for developing new Cursor rules for currently uncovered critical workflows and development practices. Many important aspects of the repository workflow currently lack dedicated rules, creating gaps in guidance for important development activities. This initiative will ensure comprehensive coverage of all important development workflows.
