# Plan: Implement a Hierarchical Rule Structure with Cross-References

## Overview

This plan outlines the approach for transforming the Cursor rules from independent documents into a navigable, interconnected knowledge system with explicit cross-references between related rules. This will improve discoverability, context sharing, and the overall effectiveness of the AI assistance provided by the rules.

[Feature 1: Implement a Hierarchical Rule Structure with Cross-References](../features.md#feature-1-implement-a-hierarchical-rule-structure-with-cross-references)

## Success Criteria

- All rules include explicit cross-references to related rules
- A central "root" rule exists that serves as an entry point to the rule system
- Cross-references follow a consistent format
- Cross-references are valid and up-to-date
- The AI can effectively navigate between related rules
- Users receive more contextually complete responses

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Rule Relationship Mapping (1-2 weeks)

**Objective**: Map the relationships between rules and establish the foundation for cross-references

**Tasks**:

   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Complete visual diagram (using Mermaid or similar) showing all rules and their relationships
     - Identification of primary and secondary connections
     - Documentation of parent-child and peer relationships

2. Define standard linking format
   - **Complexity**: Low
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Acceptance Criteria**:
     - Documented syntax for cross-references
     - Examples showing proper usage
     - Consistent format that works across all rules
     - Standard format specified as follows:
       ```markdown
       <!-- Reference format for linking to other rules -->
       See [rule-name](mdc:./cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc) for details on X.

       <!-- Alternative format with custom text -->
       For more information on X, refer to [Custom Text](mdc:./cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc).
       ```

       ```json
       {
         "rules": [
           {
             "id": "typescript-patterns",
             "name": "TypeScript Patterns",
             "description": "Guidelines for writing efficient TypeScript code",
             "relatedRules": ["eslint-config-usage", "prettier-config-usage"],
             "category": "code-style",
             "priority": "high"
           },
           // Additional rules...
         ]
       }
       ```
     - Clear documentation on how to maintain and update this registry file

### Phase 2: Rule Content Updates (2-3 weeks)

     - All identified relationships are represented
     - Section format follows:
       ```markdown
       ## Related Rules

       - [eslint-config-usage](mdc:./.cursor/rules/eslint-config-usage.mdc) - For ESLint setup when using TypeScript
       - [prettier-config-usage](mdc:./.cursor/rules/prettier-config-usage.mdc) - For Prettier formatting with TypeScript
       ```
     - Complete testing to ensure correct rendering in the Cursor IDE

2. Create entry point rule
