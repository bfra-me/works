# Project Features

This document tracks features for improving the Cursor rules system in the bfra.me/works repository.

## Current Features

### Feature 0: Integrate Vibe-Tools Playbook as First-Class Memory File

- **Description**: Integrate `vibe-tools-playbook.md` into the memory file system as a first-class project knowledge file. Ensure it is referenced in all relevant documentation, rules, and memory files, and is discoverable and standardized according to memory-management guidelines. Incorporate feedback from the integration plan and review.
