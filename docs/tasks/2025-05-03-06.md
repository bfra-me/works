# Task: Update existing rules to match template (except vibe-tools)

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Update all existing Cursor rules (except vibe-tools.mdc) to match the standardized rule format template. This task involves reviewing each rule file in the `.cursor/rules/` directory, comparing its structure to the template, and making the necessary modifications to ensure consistency. This includes updating frontmatter, reorganizing sections, reformatting content, and ensuring all required sections are present and properly formatted.

The vibe-tools.mdc file is an exception to this standardization effort and should maintain its current format due to its specialized nature and functionality.

This standardization effort will improve the overall quality and maintainability of the rules system by ensuring a consistent experience for AI assistants and users alike. It will also make it easier to identify and fix issues, extend functionality, and maintain the rule ecosystem over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All rules (except vibe-tools.mdc) follow the standardized template structure
- No formatting inconsistencies across standardized rules
- All standardized rules contain the required sections:
  - Proper frontmatter with name, description, filters
  - Overview/introduction
  - Rule content with proper formatting
  - Examples section with input/output patterns
  - Metadata section with version, priority, tags
- Examples are updated to follow the standard format
- All metadata is verified and consistent
- Cross-references between rules use proper linking syntax
- No content is lost during restructuring
- Rules are classified correctly by application type
- Version numbers are updated appropriately to reflect changes
- vibe-tools.mdc remains in its original format with appropriate frontmatter

## Complexity

High

## Estimated Effort

5 days

## Status

In Progress

## Assignee

Unassigned

## Notes

- Create a checklist or validation script to verify each rule
- Consider batching rules by type or category for more efficient updates
- Test each updated rule to ensure its functionality is preserved
- Document any significant issues discovered during the update process
- Consider creating a validation tool to check rule conformance
- This task may reveal rules that should be consolidated (related to Phase 3)

## Implementation History

- **2025-05-15**: Updated the ai-agile-workflow.mdc rule by removing non-standard metadata fields ('changelog' and 'last_updated') to align with cursor-rules-creation.mdc guidelines. This represents partial progress on the task, but not full completion.
- **2025-05-16**: Verified task status and corrected it to "In Progress" as only 1 of 28 rules has been updated to match the template format.
- **2025-05-16**: Modified task requirements to explicitly exclude vibe-tools.mdc from the standardization effort, as this rule should maintain its specialized format.
