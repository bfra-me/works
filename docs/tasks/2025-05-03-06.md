## Description

Update all existing Cursor rules to match the standardized rule format template. This task involves reviewing each rule file in the `.cursor/rules/` directory, comparing its structure to the template, and making the necessary modifications to ensure consistency. This includes updating frontmatter, reorganizing sections, reformatting content, and ensuring all required sections are present and properly formatted.

This standardization effort will improve the overall quality and maintainability of the rules system by ensuring a consistent experience for AI assistants and users alike. It will also make it easier to identify and fix issues, extend functionality, and maintain the rule ecosystem over time.
