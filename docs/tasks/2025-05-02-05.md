## Notes

According to the workflow status, there's already a plan for version control metadata in Cursor rules that includes:
- Inventory all .mdc files in .cursor/rules/
- Ensure a YAML metadata block (with priority, version, tags, changelog) is present at the end of the <rule> block
- Update or add metadata blocks as needed
- Update cursor-rules-creation.mdc
- Document changes in changelogs

This task will implement this plan.

## Progress Updates

- Created version control template at `docs/templates/version-control-template.md` (2025-05-02)
- Updated cursor-rules-creation.mdc to include metadata guidelines and examples (2025-05-02)
- Added metadata section to cursor-rules-creation.mdc at version 1.1 (2025-05-02)
- Created script at `scripts/check-rule-metadata.sh` to inventory rules and check for metadata (2025-05-02)
- Ran inventory script to identify rules missing metadata sections (2025-05-02)

## Next Steps

- Add metadata sections to the 4 remaining rules that are missing them:
  - changeset-workflow.mdc
  - prettier-config-usage.mdc
  - rule-automation-script.mdc
  - typescript-patterns.mdc
