# Task: Document rule application types

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-11

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Create clear documentation on the different types of rule application (auto-attached, agent requested, always applied, and manual) and provide guidelines for when to use each type. This task involves analyzing the current rule application patterns, documenting best practices, and creating clear explanations of each application type with examples. The goal is to help rule creators understand which application type is most appropriate for their specific rule.

This task focuses on improving the understanding of how rules are activated in different contexts, ensuring rules are properly configured for their intended use case.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Clear definitions of each rule application type:
  - Auto-attached rules (triggered by file types)
  - Agent-requested rules (requested based on context)
  - Always-applied rules (global application)
  - Manual rules (explicit inclusion)
- Guidelines for when to use each application type
- Examples of proper frontmatter configuration for each type
- Use cases and scenarios that favor each application type
- Documentation of how application types affect rule visibility and priority
- Best practices for combining multiple application methods
- Documentation of potential pitfalls or common mistakes

## Dependencies

- Rule format template (Task ID: 2025-05-03-05)

## Notes

- Focus on clarity and practical examples
- Consult the 00-rule-index document for existing guidance on application types
- Consider creating a decision flow chart to help select the appropriate application type
- Document both the frontmatter configuration and the behavioral implications of each type
- Remember that rules are contextual documents for AI assistants, not software requiring complex activation logic
