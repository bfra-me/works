## Task ID: 2025-05-06-13

## Related Plan

[Integrate Vibe-Tools into AI-Agile Workflow Rule](mdc:docs/plans/vibe-tools-integration-plan.md)

## Description

Add explicit links (`mdc:` syntax) to `vibe-tools.mdc` whenever `vibe-tools` commands are mentioned in the updated `ai-agile-workflow.mdc`. Add/verify links to `memory-management.mdc` in the automation section. Add links to relevant memory files (e.g., `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md`). Update the "Related Rules" section to include `vibe-tools.mdc`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All mentions of `vibe-tools` commands in `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` are linked to `vibe-tools.mdc` using `mdc:` syntax.
- Links to `memory-management.mdc` are present and correct in the memory automation section.
- Links to other relevant memory files (like `agile-workflow-enhancements.md`) are added if appropriate.
- The "Related Rules" section of `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` includes `vibe-tools.mdc`.
