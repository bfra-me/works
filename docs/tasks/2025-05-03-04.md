# Task: Update Cursor Rule Registry and Cross-References

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-04

## Related Plan

[Develop Rules for Missing Critical Cursor Rules](../plans/develop-missing-cursor-rules.md)

## Description

Update the Cursor rule registry and establish comprehensive bidirectional cross-references between all Cursor rule files. This task will ensure that all newly developed Cursor rules are properly integrated into the existing rule system, with clear references connecting related concepts across rules.

## Problem Analysis

- New workflow rules need integration into the rule registry
- Many rules lack proper bidirectional cross-references
- The rule relationship diagram needs updating
- Reference validity needs verification
- Connections between rules are not always clear

## Acceptance Criteria

- Addition of all new rules to registry.json
- Creation of bidirectional cross-references
- Updated rule relationship diagram
- Documentation of rule connections
- Verification of reference validity

## Complexity

Medium

## Estimated Effort

1 day

## Solution Design

1. Manual cross-reference approach:
   - Manually review each rule for connection points
   - Add cross-references based on content analysis
   - Pros: Highly accurate, contextual references
   - Cons: Time-consuming, may miss some connections

2. Automated analysis approach:
   - Use NLP/keyword analysis to identify related concepts
   - Generate suggested cross-references
   - Manually verify and implement
   - Pros: More efficient initial discovery
   - Cons: Requires additional verification

## Implementation

- [ ] Audit all rules for cross-reference opportunities
  - [ ] Create checklist of all rules
  - [ ] Identify related concepts between rules
  - Success criteria: Comprehensive relationship map
  - Dependencies: Access to all rule content

- [ ] Update rule registry
  - [ ] Add entries for all new workflow rules
  - [ ] Ensure metadata is consistent
  - Success criteria: Complete registry with all rules
  - Dependencies: Completion of new workflow rules

- [ ] Create bidirectional cross-references
  - [ ] Implement references using proper mdc: syntax
  - [ ] Ensure context for each reference
  - Success criteria: Comprehensive cross-references
  - Dependencies: Relationship map

- [ ] Update rule relationship diagram
  - [ ] Add new workflow rules
  - [ ] Update connections
  - [ ] Ensure diagram reflects current structure
  - Success criteria: Accurate visual representation
  - Dependencies: Updated registry and cross-references

- [ ] Verify reference validity
  - [ ] Check all links for correct paths
  - [ ] Ensure proper mdc: syntax throughout
  - [ ] Test navigation between rules
  - Success criteria: All references working correctly
  - Dependencies: Cross-reference implementation

Unassigned

## Notes

This task is a critical integration step that will tie together all the Cursor rules developed in previous phases. Special attention should be paid to ensuring that the relationship diagram accurately reflects the logical connections between Cursor rules. All cross-references must use the proper mdc: syntax as defined in the cursor-rule-cross-references rule.

## Dependencies

- Completion of Phases 2 and 3 workflow rules
- Access to rule registry
- Ability to modify all rule files

## Status

### 2025-05-03

Not Started

- What's working: Initial plan in place
- What's not: Not started yet
- Blocking issues: Dependent on completion of Phase 3 rules
- Next actions: Begin auditing rules for cross-reference opportunities
- Documentation updates needed:
  - [ ] Rule registry documentation
  - [ ] Cross-reference navigation guide

## History

### 2025-05-03 - Initial Planning

- ü§î Decisions: Focus on bidirectional references to create a coherent knowledge network
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Will enable easier navigation between related rules
