# Task: Prioritize rule application

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-14

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Develop a system for prioritizing rule application when multiple rules apply to the same context. This task involves creating clear guidelines for determining which rules take precedence in different situations, documenting priority levels, and establishing a hierarchy for rule application. The guidance should help AI assistants and developers understand how to resolve conflicts when multiple rules are applicable.

Prioritizing rule application will improve the predictability of rule behavior, reduce confusion when multiple rules apply, and ensure that the most relevant guidance is surfaced in any given context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Clear definition of priority levels for rules
- Rule hierarchy that establishes which types of rules take precedence
- Guidelines for applying priority in different contexts
- Documentation of how rule metadata affects priority
- Explanation of how rule type influences priority
- Examples of priority application in common conflict scenarios
- Documentation of override mechanisms when needed
- Clear guidance on how to indicate priority in rule metadata

## Dependencies

- Add conflict resolution guidance (Task ID: 2025-05-03-10)

## Notes

- Focus on practical guidance rather than complex algorithms
- Consider both rule type and content when determining priority
- Provide clear examples of priority resolution
- Document how specificity impacts priority
- Remember that the goal is to surface the most relevant context to AI assistants
- Keep priority systems simple and understandable
