# Task: Perform Final Review of AI-Agile Workflow Rule

## Task ID: 2025-05-06-16

## Related Plan

[Integrate Vibe-Tools into AI-Agile Workflow Rule](mdc:docs/plans/vibe-tools-integration-plan.md)

## Description

Read through the entire updated `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule for clarity, correctness, and consistency. Verify that all integration points from the analysis document (`docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md`) have been addressed. Ensure command examples are accurate and easy to understand.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The updated `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` is clear, correct, and consistent.
- All planned `vibe-tools` integration points are addressed.
- Command examples are accurate, well-formatted, and understandable.
- The rule is ready for use.

### Review Findings Summary

A thorough review of the `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule, performed on 2025-05-15, has identified that while the rule has been significantly enhanced with `vibe-tools` integration, there are several areas requiring attention before it can be considered fully complete. The current status is **Largely Complete** but requires specific refinements.

### 1. Vibe-Tools Integration Completeness

**Status:** LARGELY COMPLETE

**Strengths:**
- Integration of `vibe-tools` across all major workflow stages
- Clear command examples for most scenarios
- Comprehensive integration in Feature Definition, Plan Creation, Task Generation, and Task Execution stages

**Areas Requiring Attention:**
- **Memory File Automation Section:**
  - Missing script examples for "Sprint Planning Integration" and "Retrospective Insights Processing" from `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md`
  - Need for clearer guidance on how automation scripts fit into the workflow lifecycle
  - Lack of explicit examples for Knowledge Graph updates via `vibe-tools mcp run` in memory automation scripts

### 2. Command Example Accuracy and Clarity

**Status:** NEEDS REFINEMENT

**Issues Found:**
- Incorrect usage of `--with-doc` with `vibe-tools web` (option only supported by `ask`, `plan`, `repo`, and `doc` commands)
- Fragile approach to handling complex/multi-line prompts in shell commands (especially in automation script examples)
- Lack of explicit examples using the temporary file method for complex prompts as recommended in `vibe-tools.mdc` and reinforced by `self-improvement.mdc`

**Recommendations:**
- Correct `--with-doc` usage to align with supported commands
- Add examples using the temporary file method for handling complex prompts in scripts:
  ```bash
  PROMPT_TEXT="Update the workflow-status.md memory file with..."
  TMP_FILE=$(mktemp)
  echo -e "$PROMPT_TEXT" > "$TMP_FILE"
  vibe-tools ask "$(cat "$TMP_FILE")" --save-to workflow-status-updates.md
  rm "$TMP_FILE"
  ```

### 3. Rule Structure and Formatting

**Status:** STRONG BUT NEEDS MINOR UPDATES

**Strengths:**
- Well-organized structure with logical sections
- Consistent formatting of headings, lists, code blocks
- Proper use of `mdc:` links
- Comprehensive examples section

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Metadata block missing `last_updated` and `changelog` fields (recommended in current `cursor-rules-creation.mdc` guidelines)
- Need for reinforced guidance on obtaining dates per `date-consistency-enforcer.mdc` near template examples

### 4. Prerequisites Status

**Critical Issue:** The prerequisite tasks for this final review have not been started:
- Task `2025-05-06-13` (Add/Update Cross-References) - Status: Not Started
- Task `2025-05-06-14` (Ensure Rule Structure Compliance) - Status: Not Started
- Task `2025-05-06-15` (Update Rule Metadata) - Status: Not Started

### Recommendations for Completion

1. **Complete the prerequisite tasks first** (2025-05-06-13, 14, and 15)
2. Address the specific issues identified in this review:
   - Add missing script examples for Sprint Planning and Retrospective Insights
   - Correct `--with-doc` usage with `vibe-tools` commands
   - Add examples using the temporary file method for complex prompts
   - Add `last_updated` and `changelog` to metadata
   - Reinforce date retrieval guidance where appropriate
3. Perform a final verification after all changes to ensure consistency
4. Update the status of this task to "Completed" once all refinements are implemented

This review provides a solid foundation for finalizing the `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule and completing the Vibe-Tools integration.
