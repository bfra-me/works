# Task: Create a Relationship Diagram for All Rules

## Task ID: 2025-04-25-01

## Related Plan

[Implement a Hierarchical Rule Structure with Cross-References](../plans/cursor-rules-hierarchy.md)

## Description

Create a comprehensive relationship diagram for all existing Cursor rules, showing their connections, dependencies, and hierarchical structure. This will serve as the foundation for adding cross-references between rules and creating a navigable knowledge system.

## Problem Analysis

- Current Cursor rules exist as independent files without explicit relationships
- Users and AI assistants cannot easily discover related rules
- There is no clear entry point or navigation structure for the rule system
- Some rules have implicit relationships that should be made explicit
- Missing visual representation of how rules relate to each other

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete visual diagram (using Mermaid or similar) showing all rules and their relationships
- Identification of primary and secondary connections between rules
- Documentation of parent-child relationships (hierarchical structure)
- Documentation of peer relationships (same-level connections)
- The diagram should include all existing rules in the .cursor/rules directory
- The diagram should be clear, readable, and maintainable
- Relationships should reflect actual content connections, not just superficial similarities

## Complexity

Medium

## Estimated Effort

3 days

## Solution Design

1. Approach 1: Manual Analysis and Diagram Creation
   - Description: Manually analyze all rule files, identify relationships, and create the diagram
   - Pros: High accuracy, deep understanding of relationships
   - Cons: Time-consuming, subjective judgment required
   - Technical considerations: Requires in-depth knowledge of all rules

2. Approach 2: Semi-automated Analysis with AI Assistance
   - Description: Use AI to help identify potential relationships, then manually verify and create the diagram
   - Pros: Faster, may identify non-obvious connections
   - Cons: May miss nuanced relationships, requires validation
   - Technical considerations: Requires good prompting techniques for AI

## Implementation

- [ ] Inventory all existing Cursor rules
  - [ ] Create list of all .mdc files in .cursor/rules
  - [ ] Document basic metadata (title, description, purpose)
  - Success criteria: Complete inventory with key information
  - Dependencies: Access to repository

- [ ] Analyze rule content and identify relationships
  - [ ] Read each rule in detail
  - [ ] Note topical overlaps and connections
  - [ ] Identify parent-child relationships
  - [ ] Document explicit references between rules
  - Success criteria: Comprehensive list of relationships
  - Dependencies: Completed inventory

- [ ] Draft initial relationship diagram
  - [ ] Create Mermaid diagram showing all rules
  - [ ] Use appropriate relationship lines/arrows
  - [ ] Group related rules visually
  - [ ] Include clear labels for relationship types
  - Success criteria: Visual representation of all rules and relationships
  - Dependencies: Completed relationship analysis

- [ ] Review and refine diagram
  - [ ] Validate relationships with team members
  - [ ] Ensure clarity and readability
  - [ ] Test with potential users
  - [ ] Make necessary adjustments
  - Success criteria: Validated diagram that clearly shows relationships
  - Dependencies: Initial diagram draft

- [ ] Finalize and document
  - [ ] Create final version of diagram
  - [ ] Add explanatory documentation
  - [ ] Include in appropriate documentation files
  - [ ] Prepare for implementation in subsequent tasks
  - Success criteria: Production-ready diagram with documentation
  - Dependencies: Reviewed and refined diagram

## Assignee

Unassigned

## Notes

- Consider color-coding different types of relationships
- Consider creating multiple views (high-level overview, detailed connections)
- This diagram will be referenced heavily in subsequent tasks
- The diagram should be in a format that can be included in the rule files
- Consider future maintenance of the diagram as rules evolve

## Dependencies

- Access to all existing Cursor rule files
- Understanding of rule purpose and content
- Mermaid or similar diagramming capability
- Knowledge of intended rule usage patterns

## Status

### 2025-04-25 10:00

In Progress

- What's working: Initial inventory of rules completed
- What's not: Still analyzing detailed relationships
- Blocking issues: None
- Next actions: Complete relationship analysis and start draft diagram
- Documentation updates needed:
  - [ ] Update to include diagram in cursor-rules-hierarchy.md
  - [ ] Prepare for inclusion in root.mdc rule

## History
