### Session 1 (2025-05-01)
**Focus**: Foundation Work - Creating Rule Index
**Status**: Completed
**Files Modified**:
- Created `.cursor/rules/00-rule-index.mdc`
- Created version control template (moved to docs/templates/)

### Next Steps
- Implement version control across all rules
- Update rule files with version history

## Notes
- The index currently lists 18 rules, all of which need version metadata added
- Some rules already have version information, but in inconsistent formats
- Need to establish a standard location for changelog information in each rule
- Original improvement tracker was incorrectly placed in .cursor/rules/
