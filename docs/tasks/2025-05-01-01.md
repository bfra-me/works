**Files Modified**:
- Added version metadata to all rule files
- Updated rule index with versioning guidelines

### Session 3 (2025-05-03)
**Focus**: Structural Standardization - Initial Tasks
**Status**: Completed
**Files Modified**:
- Created rule format template
- Added rule application types documentation to rule index
- Enhanced rule creation guidance in cursor-rules-creation.mdc

### Session 4 (2025-05-04)
**Focus**: Conflict Management
**Status**: Completed
**Files Modified**:
- Added conflict resolution guidance
- Prioritized rule application
- Documented rule interaction patterns

### Session 5 (2025-05-05 to 2025-05-16)
**Focus**: Continued Implementation
**Status**: In Progress
**Files Modified**:
- Enhanced rule examples and documentation
- Started updating existing rules to match templates
- Started creating basic helper scripts

### Next Steps
- Complete updating existing rules to match template
- Implement content optimization tasks
- Complete helper scripts

## Notes
- The rule index currently lists 29 rules
- All Foundation Work is complete (Phase 1)
- Structural Standardization (Phase 2) is partially complete with 3 of 4 tasks finished
- Content Optimization (Phase 3) is partially complete with 1 of 3 tasks finished
- Conflict Management (Phase 4) is mostly complete with 3 of 4 tasks finished
- The rule index includes comprehensive sections on rule application types, versioning guidelines, and automatic update procedures
- Multiple sessions beyond the initial rule index creation have made significant progress on Phases 2-4
- Rule cross-references are implemented using the mdc: syntax
- All rules now include version metadata following semantic versioning principles
- Regular maintenance is required to keep the rule index in sync with changes to individual rules
