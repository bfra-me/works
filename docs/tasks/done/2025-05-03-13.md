# Task: Enhance rule examples and documentation

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-13

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Improve the quality and effectiveness of examples and documentation across all Cursor rules. This task involves reviewing existing rules, identifying those with weak or insufficient examples, and enhancing them with more relevant, clear, and comprehensive examples. Additionally, improve the overall documentation within rules to better explain their purpose, usage patterns, and expected outcomes.

Good examples are critical for AI assistants to understand how to apply the guidance in rules. This task will ensure that all rules have clear, relevant examples that demonstrate their intended use, making them more effective at providing context to AI assistants.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Review of all existing rules to identify those with weak examples
- Enhanced examples that:
  - Clearly demonstrate the rule's intended use
  - Show both input and expected output
  - Cover common use cases
  - Include edge cases where appropriate
- Improved documentation that:
  - Clearly explains the rule's purpose
  - Provides context for when the rule applies
  - Includes usage patterns and best practices
  - Is written in clear, concise language
- Consistent format for examples across all rules
- Examples that demonstrate different variations of rule application
- Clear distinction between examples and implementation guidance
