# Task: Review Source Analysis Document

## Task ID: 2025-05-06-01

## Related Plan

[Vibe-Tools Integration Plan](/docs/plans/vibe-tools-integration-plan.md)

## Description

Thoroughly review the `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md` document to understand the proposed integration points, command examples, and automation strategies for incorporating `vibe-tools` into the `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule. Identify key command templates and script examples for inclusion.

## Problem Analysis

- The current `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule does not include guidance on using `vibe-tools` for workflow tasks
- The `agile-workflow-enhancements.md` document contains valuable analysis on integration points
- We need to extract specific command templates and examples from this document
- Integration should be coherent with the existing workflow structure

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Vibe-Tools Integration per Workflow Stage

- **Feature Definition/Research:**
  - Tool(s): `vibe-tools web`
  - Purpose: Competitor analysis, best practice research, understanding user needs, validating feature ideas.
  - Example Command(s):
    ```bash
    vibe-tools web "What are the current best practices for implementing cross-references in documentation that need to work in both web and IDE environments?"
    vibe-tools web "Research best practices for implementing semantic versioning in a monorepo structure similar to our project. Focus on automation and integration with existing workflows."
    # If a specific URL is provided for research, use --with-doc
    # vibe-tools web "Summarize key points from https://example.com/spec" --with-doc=https://example.com/spec
    ```
- **Plan Creation:**
  - Tool(s): `vibe-tools plan`
  - Purpose: Generate structured plans, estimate effort, prototype solutions, break down epics/stories.
  - Example Command(s):
    ```bash
    vibe-tools plan "Create a detailed implementation plan for adding cross-referencing capabilities to Cursor rules. Include phases, tasks, acceptance criteria and estimated story points."
    vibe-tools plan "Break down this user story: As a user, I want to reset my password via email so I can regain access if I forget it. Detail backend, frontend, integration, and testing tasks with skill requirements."
    vibe-tools plan "Estimate effort for implementing a TypeScript config package with story points using Fibonacci scale (1,2,3,5,8,13). Identify dependencies and uncertainties."
    # For plans based on specific documents:
    # vibe-tools plan "Create an implementation plan based on the requirements in this document" --with-doc=https://example.com/requirements.md
    ```
- **Task Generation:**
  - Tool(s): `vibe-tools plan`, `vibe-tools repo`
  - Purpose: Break down plans/features into discrete, actionable tasks with repository context.
  - Example Command(s):
    ```bash
    vibe-tools repo "Break down the implementation of cross-references into discrete tasks based on the current structure of Cursor rules. Consider file paths, parsing requirements, and rendering approaches."
    vibe-tools plan "Break down this feature: Cross-referencing between Cursor rules" --save-to=docs/tasks/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-01.md
    ```
- **Task Execution:**
  - Tool(s): `vibe-tools repo`, `vibe-tools web`, `vibe-tools browser`
  - Purpose: Gather codebase context, research solutions, troubleshoot, interact with web applications during development.
  - Example Command(s):
    ```bash
    vibe-tools repo "Show me all places where memory files are read or written to understand the current pattern"
    vibe-tools web "What's the most efficient regex pattern for detecting markdown links to specific file types?"
    vibe-tools browser act "Click the login button and enter 'testuser' in the username field" --url=http://localhost:3000
    ```
- **Status Updates/Reviews:**
  - Tool(s): `vibe-tools repo`
  - Purpose: Generate summaries of completed work for status updates, sprint reviews, or preparing demonstrations.
  - Example Command(s):
    ```bash
    vibe-tools repo "Summarize the changes I've made to implement cross-references between rule files, with examples of before and after."
    vibe-tools repo "Summarize the current sprint status, including completed tasks, in-progress tasks, and upcoming tasks"
    ```

### 2. Memory File Automation Strategies

- **Workflow Status Updates:**
  - Script Concept: Use `vibe-tools repo` to get status (e.g., sprint summary, recent commits), pipe to `vibe-tools ask` (or `mcp run`) to format for `workflow-status.md`.
  - Key Command Chain Example (Conceptual):
    ```bash
    # Get status summary
    vibe-tools repo "Summarize current sprint status..." > sprint_summary.txt
    # Format for memory file
    SPRINT_SUMMARY=$(<sprint_summary.txt)
    vibe-tools ask "Format this as a markdown update for workflow-status.md with the following sections:
    - Current State
    - Task History
    - Recent Updates
    - Updated timestamp
    \nContent to format:
    $SPRINT_SUMMARY" > workflow_update.md
    # Manual merge/append of workflow_update.md into workflow-status.md would follow
    ```
- **Daily Standup Automation:**
  - Script Concept: Use `vibe-tools repo` for last 24hr activity, pipe to `vibe-tools ask` for standup report formatting.
  - Key Command Chain Example (Conceptual):
    ```bash
    vibe-tools repo "Summarize last 24 hours of development activity..." > daily_activity.txt
    DAILY_ACTIVITY=$(<daily_activity.txt)
    vibe-tools ask "Format this as a daily standup report for $(date +%Y-%m-%d) with:
    - Completed work
    - In-progress items
    - Blockers
    - Plans for today
    \nContent to format:
    $DAILY_ACTIVITY" > standup_update.md
    # Append to a standup history file
    ```
- **Domain Knowledge Updates:**
  - Script Concept: Use `vibe-tools repo` to find completed tasks (e.g., from `docs/tasks/done/`), extract knowledge using another `vibe-tools repo` call per task, then format with `vibe-tools ask`.
  - Key Command Chain Example (Conceptual - simplified for one task):
    ```bash
    TASK_FILE="docs/tasks/done/YYYY-MM-DD-XX.md" # Example completed task
    vibe-tools repo "Extract domain knowledge from $TASK_FILE including new concepts, patterns, decisions, lessons learned" > domain_extract.txt
    DOMAIN_EXTRACT=$(<domain_extract.txt)
    vibe-tools ask "Format this for domain-knowledge.md under relevant sections:
    - Core Concepts
    - Implementation Patterns
    - Technical Decisions
    - Terminology
    \nContent to format:
    $DOMAIN_EXTRACT" > domain_updates.md
    # Manual merge/append into domain-knowledge.md
    ```
- **Sprint Planning Integration:**
  - Script Concept: Use `vibe-tools plan` to generate plan details, then pipe output to `vibe-tools ask` to format into a markdown document.
  - Key Command Chain Example (Conceptual):
    ```bash
    vibe-tools plan "Create a sprint plan for feature X..." > sprint_plan_raw.txt
    SPRINT_PLAN=$(<sprint_plan_raw.txt)
    vibe-tools ask "Format this into a structured sprint plan markdown document with:
    - Sprint details
    - User stories
    - Tasks
    - Estimates
    - Risks
    \nContent to format:
    $SPRINT_PLAN" > sprint_X_plan.md
    ```
- **Retrospective Insights Processing:**
  - Script Concept: Extract insights from retrospective notes using vibe-tools.
  - Key Command Chain Example (Conceptual):
    ```bash
    # UPDATED: Using POSIX shell escaping for multi-line input
    RETRO_NOTES=$(<retrospective_notes.md)
    vibe-tools ask "Extract key themes, action items, and positive points from these retrospective notes:\n\nContent to analyze:\n$RETRO_NOTES" > retro_summary.md
    ```
