# Task: Integrate Vibe-Tools Playbook as First-Class Memory File

## Task ID: 2025-05-07-01

## Related Plan
[docs/plans/vibe-tools-playbook-integration.md](../plans/vibe-tools-playbook-integration.md)

## Description
Migrate `vibe-tools-playbook.md` to `docs/memory/`, standardize its structure, update documentation and rule references, and ensure it is discoverable as a first-class memory file. Incorporate feedback from the integration plan and review.

## Problem Analysis
- The vibe-tools-playbook.md contains valuable information but is not properly integrated into the memory file system
- The playbook needs to follow memory-management standards for consistency and discoverability
- Current references to vibe-tools documentation are scattered and incomplete
- The playbook would benefit from being designated as the primary user guide in vibe-tools.mdc

## Acceptance Criteria
- The playbook is moved to `docs/memory/` with proper structure and formatting
- The document follows memory-management guidelines including the required `## Updated: YYYY-MM-DD` timestamp
- All relevant documentation, rules, and memory files reference the playbook
- The playbook is designated as the primary user guide in `vibe-tools.mdc`
- The rule index (`00-rule-index.mdc`) includes a reference to the playbook
- The integration is documented as a completed task

## Complexity
Medium

## Estimated Effort
4 hours

## Solution Design
1. Migration and Standardization Approach:
   - Move the file to the `docs/memory/` directory
   - Update the document structure to match memory file standards
   - Add required sections and formatting (especially the timestamp)
   - Review and align content with vibe-tools.mdc

   Pros: Maintains consistency, follows established patterns
   Cons: May require substantial restructuring of content

2. Knowledge Graph Integration (Optional):
   - Create entities for key concepts in the playbook
   - Link to related entities in the knowledge graph

   Pros: Enhances discoverability, enables AI assistants to access information
   Cons: Requires additional effort, may be deferred to a future task

## Implementation
- [x] Move `vibe-tools-playbook.md` to `docs/memory/`
  - Success criteria: File exists in `docs/memory/` directory
  - Dependencies: None

- [x] Standardize structure and add/update the `## Updated: YYYY-MM-DD` timestamp
  - Success criteria: Document follows memory file structure with proper timestamp
  - Dependencies: File moved to memory directory

- [x] Review and align playbook content with `vibe-tools.mdc` for accuracy and consistency
  - Success criteria: No contradictions or redundancies between files
  - Dependencies: None
