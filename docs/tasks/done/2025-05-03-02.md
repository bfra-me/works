# Task: Create Debugging and Troubleshooting Cursor Rule

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-02

## Related Plan

[Develop Rules for Missing Critical Cursor Rules](../plans/develop-missing-cursor-rules.md)

## Description

Create a dedicated Cursor rule file for debugging and troubleshooting processes in the monorepo. This rule will provide developers with structured guidance on identifying and resolving common issues, implementing effective logging, and utilizing debugging tools specific to the repository's technologies.

## Problem Analysis

- Developers lack consistent guidance for troubleshooting common issues
- Logging practices vary widely across packages
- Debugging approaches are not standardized
- Performance troubleshooting requires specialized knowledge
- Environment-specific issues are not well-documented

## Acceptance Criteria

- Development of "debugging-guide.mdc" covering:
  - Common error patterns and solutions
  - Logging best practices
  - Debugging tools and techniques
  - Performance troubleshooting
  - Environment-specific issues
- Step-by-step troubleshooting workflows
- Decision trees for problem diagnosis
- Proper frontmatter configuration
- Cross-references to related rules

## Complexity

Medium

## Estimated Effort

1.5 days

## Solution Design

1. Problem-oriented approach:

   - Organize by common error types and symptoms
   - Provide solutions for each problem category
   - Pros: Directly addresses developer pain points
   - Cons: May miss systematic approaches

2. Tool-oriented approach:
   - Focus on proper use of debugging tools
   - Teach systematic debugging methodologies
   - Pros: Builds debugging skills
   - Cons: May require more learning before application

## Implementation

- [ ] Research common issues

  - [ ] Analyze GitHub issues and support tickets
  - [ ] Interview developers about recurring problems
  - Success criteria: Comprehensive inventory of common issues
  - Dependencies: Access to issue history

- [ ] Document logging best practices

  - [ ] Define logging standards
  - [ ] Create examples of good and bad logging
  - Success criteria: Clear logging guidelines
  - Dependencies: Review of current logging practices

- [ ] Create debugging workflows

  - [ ] Develop decision trees for different error types
  - [ ] Document step-by-step processes
  - Success criteria: Actionable debugging workflows
  - Dependencies: Research findings

- [ ] Document performance troubleshooting

  - [ ] Identify common performance bottlenecks
  - [ ] Provide profiling and optimization techniques
  - Success criteria: Clear performance debugging guide
  - Dependencies: Knowledge of performance issues

- [ ] Document environment-specific issues
  - [ ] Catalog differences between dev/staging/prod
  - [ ] Address common deployment issues
  - Success criteria: Environment troubleshooting guide
  - Dependencies: Knowledge of different environments

Unassigned

## Notes

This Cursor rule should be practical and example-driven, focusing on real issues encountered in the repository rather than general debugging theory. It will be stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory and must follow the proper format with frontmatter, rule element, and metadata.

## Dependencies

- Phase 2 core workflow rules completion
- Access to issue history and common problems
- Knowledge of the development environment setup

## Status

### 2025-05-03

Completed
