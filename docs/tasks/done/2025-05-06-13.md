# Task: Update Cross-References in ai-agile-workflow.mdc

## Task ID: 2025-05-06-13

## Related Plan

[Integrate Vibe-Tools into AI-Agile Workflow Rule](/`docs/plans/vibe-tools-integration-plan.md)

## Description

Add explicit links (`mdc:` syntax) to `vibe-tools.mdc` whenever `vibe-tools` commands are mentioned. Add/verify links to `memory-management.mdc` in the automation section. Add links to relevant memory files (e.g., `agile-workflow-enhancements.md`). Update the "Related Rules" section to include `vibe-tools.mdc`.

## Problem Analysis

- Cross-references between rules are not consistently implemented
- Mentions of `vibe-tools` commands lack proper links to the source rule
- Memory file references in the automation section need verification
- The "Related Rules" section may be missing important connections

## Acceptance Criteria

- All mentions of `vibe-tools` commands in `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` are linked to `vibe-tools.mdc` using `mdc:` syntax.
- Links to `memory-management.mdc` are present and correct in the memory automation section.
- Links to other relevant memory files (like `agile-workflow-enhancements.md`) are added if appropriate.
- The "Related Rules" section of `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` includes `vibe-tools.mdc`.

## Complexity

Low

## Estimated Effort

2 hours

## Solution Design

1. Approach:
   - Systematically review the entire ai-agile-workflow.mdc file
   - Identify all mentions of vibe-tools commands
   - Add appropriate mdc: links
   - Verify and update the "Related Rules" section
   - Ensure consistent linking format throughout

## Implementation

- [x] Review the entire ai-agile-workflow.mdc file to identify all vibe-tools command mentions

  - [x] Find all instances in the workflow stages
  - [x] Find all instances in the automation section
  - [x] Find all instances in examples
  - Success criteria: Complete inventory of all vibe-tools mentions
  - Dependencies: None

- [x] Add explicit links to vibe-tools.mdc for all command mentions

  - [x] Use proper mdc: syntax
  - [x] Maintain consistent linking format
  - Success criteria: All mentions properly linked
  - Dependencies: Completed inventory

- [x] Verify and update links to memory-management.mdc

  - [x] Check the automation section links
  - [x] Ensure correct and consistent syntax
  - Success criteria: All memory-management.mdc references properly linked
  - Dependencies: None

- [x] Add links to relevant memory files

  - [x] Link to agile-workflow-enhancements.md where mentioned
  - Success criteria: All memory file references properly linked
  - Dependencies: None

- [x] Update "Related Rules" section
  - [x] Verify vibe-tools.mdc is included
  - [x] Ensure consistent format with other entries
  - Success criteria: Complete and consistent "Related Rules" section
  - Dependencies: None

## Notes

This task is part of the overall vibe-tools integration and serves to improve the navigation and cross-referencing between the rule file and its supporting documentation. All necessary changes were completed in a single edit to maintain consistency.

## Analysis Findings

All required cross-references have been implemented. The ai-agile-workflow.mdc file now properly links to vibe-tools.mdc whenever vibe-tools commands are mentioned. The memory-management.mdc links in the automation section have been verified and added where needed. The agile-workflow-enhancements.md file has been linked appropriately, and the "Related Rules" section includes vibe-tools.mdc.

## Dependencies

- Task 2025-05-06-11 (Create missing cross-references in rule index)
- Task 2025-05-06-12 (Add examples section to vibe-tools-playbook.md memory file)

## Status

### 2025-05-15 12:00

Completed

- What's working: All cross-references successfully implemented
- What's not: N/A
- Blocking issues: None
- Next actions: Move to next task (2025-05-06-14)
- Documentation updates needed:
  - [x] Update workflow-status.md memory file
  - [x] Update Knowledge Graph with task completion
