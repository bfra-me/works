## Notes

- The rule registry file follows a structured format with categories:
  - Development Rules (rule creation, management)
  - Workflow Rules (processes, CI/CD, etc.)
  - Coding Standards (format, patterns, practices)
  - Configuration Rules (tools, services setup)
  - Repository Structure (organization, architecture)
  - AI & Memory Management (context retention)
- Each rule entry includes:
  - Rule name with proper mdc: link
  - Brief description
  - Priority level
- The file is designed to be automatically updated by AI agents when rules are created/modified
- Automatic updates are triggered by specific phrases specified in the rule itself
