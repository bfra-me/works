# Task: Fix CI/CD Workflow Rule Frontmatter

## Task ID: 2025-05-02-03

## Related Plan

[Develop Rules for Missing Critical Workflows](../../plans/develop-missing-workflow-rules.md)

## Description

Fix the frontmatter section of the newly created CI/CD workflow rule to ensure proper auto-attachment based on file paths and content patterns. The current frontmatter configuration is not correctly triggering the rule in relevant contexts, requiring manual attachment instead of automatic application.

This task is a follow-up to the "Create CI/CD workflow rule" task and addresses an issue discovered during initial testing of the rule.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Update the frontmatter of "ci-cd-workflow.mdc" to:
  - Include appropriate globs for GitHub workflow files
  - Add content patterns for CI/CD-related terms
  - Ensure `alwaysApply` is set correctly
  - Maintain the descriptive text
- Example of correct frontmatter:
  ```
  ---
  description: Guide for understanding CI/CD processes, troubleshooting build failures, and managing release automation in the bfra.me/works monorepo
  globs: .github/workflows/*.yml, .github/workflows/*.yaml, .github/actions/*/action.yml
  alwaysApply: false
  ---
  ```
- Verify the rule auto-attaches correctly when working with workflow files
- Update related documentation to reference the corrected rule

## Notes

- Critical lesson learned: Cursor rule frontmatter formatting is very sensitive
- YAML formatting in the frontmatter must be precise
- The fix enables proper auto-attachment when users are working with GitHub workflow files
- Created documentation on proper .mdc file editing to prevent similar issues in the future
- Rule now correctly attaches when users are viewing or editing CI/CD workflow files
