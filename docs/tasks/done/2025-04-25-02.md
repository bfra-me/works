# Task: Define Standard Linking Format

## Task ID: 2025-04-25-02

## Related Plan

[Implement a Hierarchical Rule Structure with Cross-References](../plans/cursor-rules-hierarchy.md)

## Description

Define a standardized format for links within Cursor rule files (.mdc), including cross-references to other rules and links to any other files in the repository. This format will be used consistently across all rules to create a navigable knowledge system. The linking format should be clear, concise, and work well with the Cursor IDE's rendering of markdown content.

## Problem Analysis

- Currently, there is no standard way to reference other files from within Cursor rules
- References between rules are implicit or inconsistent
- Standard Markdown links don't work correctly in Cursor rules
- No clear syntax for different types of links (rules, documentation, templates, etc.)
- Need to ensure format works with markdown rendering in Cursor IDE
- Links should be parsable by automated tools for validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Documented syntax for links that is clear and consistent
- Standard format specified for ALL file links in Cursor rules:

  ```markdown
  # For links to other rules
  [rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc)

  # For links to any other repository files
  [display text](mdc:path/to/file.ext)
  ```

- Multiple examples showing proper usage in different contexts
- Documentation for how links should appear in different rule sections
- Testing in actual rule files to ensure proper rendering
- Validation that the format works in Cursor IDE's markdown rendering
- Format is parsable by automated tools for validation
- Clear distinction between linking in Cursor rules vs. regular markdown files

## Complexity

Low

## Estimated Effort

1 day

## Solution Design

1. Approach 1: mdc: Prefix Format
   - Description: Use `mdc:` prefix for all file links within Cursor rules
   - Pros: Consistent syntax for all file types, easily distinguishable, supports Cursor IDE rendering
   - Cons: Not standard markdown, requires special knowledge
   - Technical considerations: Unique to Cursor IDE environment

2. Approach 2: Differentiated Link Types
   - Description: Different formats for different link types (rules, docs, code)
   - Pros: More contextually clear, can provide more information about target
   - Cons: More complex to remember, potential for confusion
   - Technical considerations: Harder to implement tooling for validation

  - Success criteria: Comprehensive documentation with clear examples
  - Dependencies: Completed format design

- [x] Test format in actual rule files
  - [x] Implement format in test rule files
  - [x] Test links to different file types

- [x] Finalize and document
  - [x] Create final specification for the linking format
  - [x] Update plan document with the format details
  - [x] Create cursor-rule-cross-references rule
  - [x] Provide implementation guidance for task 2025-04-25-03
  - Success criteria: Production-ready format specification
  - Dependencies: Successful testing

Unassigned

## Notes

- The format must be intuitive enough for manual writing
- Consider both human readability and machine parseability
- The format will be used extensively in all rule files
- This task is critical for enabling proper navigation between rules and other files
- After defining the format, we'll need to update all existing links (task 2025-04-25-03)
- The mdc: prefix appears to be a special feature of the Cursor IDE for handling links in rule files

## Dependencies

- None - this task can start immediately
- Useful to have the relationship diagram (Task 2025-04-25-01) for context, but not strictly required

## Status

### 2025-04-29 15:00

Completed

- What's working: All criteria met; standard linking format defined and documented
- What's not: None; all implementation steps completed successfully
- Blocking issues: None
- Next actions: Proceed with task 2025-04-25-03 to update existing links
- Documentation updates needed:
  - [x] Format specification documented in architecture.md
  - [x] Cross-reference guidance added to domain-knowledge.md
  - [x] Example usage provided across documentation
