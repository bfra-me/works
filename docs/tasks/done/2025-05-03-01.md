# Task: Add API Design Standards Cursor Rule

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-01

## Related Plan

[Develop Rules for Missing Critical Cursor Rules](../plans/develop-missing-cursor-rules.md)

## Description

Create a dedicated Cursor rule file that establishes API design standards across all packages in the monorepo. This rule will provide guidance for developers to ensure consistent API patterns, type safety, deprecation practices, versioning, and documentation requirements.

## Problem Analysis

- Currently, there is no consistent guidance for API design across packages
- Different packages may use inconsistent patterns for similar functionality
- Type safety implementation varies across packages
- Developers need clear guidance on deprecation and versioning practices
- Documentation standards for public APIs are not well-defined

## Acceptance Criteria

- Creation of "api-design-standards.mdc" covering:
  - Consistent API patterns across packages
  - Type safety in public APIs
  - Deprecation policies
  - Versioning and backward compatibility
  - Documentation requirements
- Examples of ideal API designs
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Proper frontmatter configuration
- Cross-references to related rules

## Complexity

High

## Estimated Effort

2 days

## Solution Design

1. Research-based approach:
   - Analyze current API patterns across packages
   - Identify best practices already in use
   - Research industry standards for TypeScript API design
   - Pros: Grounded in actual usage and needs
   - Cons: May take longer to analyze existing code

2. Standardization approach:
   - Define new standards based on best practices
   - Create migration path for existing APIs
   - Pros: Clean, consistent standards
   - Cons: May create more work to adapt existing code

## Implementation

- [ ] Research existing API patterns
  - [ ] Analyze public exports across packages
  - [ ] Document common patterns and inconsistencies
  - Success criteria: Comprehensive inventory of API patterns
  - Dependencies: Access to codebase

- [ ] Draft rule content
  - [ ] Write section on consistent API patterns
  - [ ] Define type safety requirements
  - [ ] Document deprecation and versioning policies
  - [ ] Create documentation standards
  - Success criteria: Complete draft of rule content
  - Dependencies: Research findings

- [ ] Create examples and anti-patterns
  - [ ] Develop code examples for recommended patterns
  - [ ] Document anti-patterns to avoid
  - Success criteria: Clear, actionable examples
  - Dependencies: Draft rule content

- [ ] Configure proper frontmatter
  - [ ] Define appropriate globs for auto-attachment
  - [ ] Set description and other metadata
  - Success criteria: Working auto-attachment
  - Dependencies: None

- [ ] Add cross-references to related rules
  - [ ] Link to typescript-patterns rule
  - [ ] Link to documentation-related rules
  - Success criteria: Proper cross-references using mdc: syntax
  - Dependencies: Knowledge of related rules

## Notes

This Cursor rule should focus on public APIs that are consumed by other packages or external users. Internal APIs may follow different patterns but should still maintain type safety. Remember that this is a Cursor rule that will be stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory and must follow the proper format with frontmatter, rule element, and metadata.

## Dependencies

- Phase 2 core workflow rules completion
- Access to current package public APIs
- Knowledge of TypeScript best practices

## History

### 2025-05-03 - Implementation Complete

- ‚úÖ Created the api-design-standards.mdc file in .cursor/rules/
- ‚úÖ Included all required sections: consistent API patterns, type safety, deprecation policies, versioning, and documentation requirements
- ‚úÖ Added examples of ideal API designs and anti-patterns to avoid
- ‚úÖ Added proper frontmatter for auto-attachment
- ‚úÖ Included cross-references to related rules (typescript-patterns, dependency-management, changeset-workflow)
- ü§î Decisions: Used a comprehensive approach covering all major aspects of API design
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Task completed, no further actions needed

### 2025-05-03 - Initial Planning

- ü§î Decisions: Focus on public APIs first, then address internal APIs
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Next: Will enable more consistent API design across packages
