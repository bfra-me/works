# Task: Ensure AI-Agile Workflow Rule Structure Compliance

## Task ID: 2025-05-06-14

## Related Plan

[Integrate Vibe-Tools into AI-Agile Workflow Rule](mdc:docs/plans/vibe-tools-integration-plan.md)

## Description

Verify the entire `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` file structure (frontmatter, title, `<rule>` block, filters, actions, examples, metadata) conforms to `cursor-rules-creation.mdc`. Ensure formatting (headings, code blocks, lists) is consistent throughout the updated rule.

## Problem Analysis

- The ai-agile-workflow.mdc file needs to be verified against cursor-rules-creation.mdc standards
- All structural elements must be checked for compliance
- This is part of the quality assurance process for the vibe-tools integration
- The rule should maintain consistent formatting throughout

## Acceptance Criteria

- The `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` file adheres to the structural requirements of `cursor-rules-creation.mdc`.
- Frontmatter, rule block, filters, actions, examples, and metadata sections are correctly formatted.
- Overall document formatting (headings, lists, code blocks) is consistent and clean.

## Complexity

Low

## Estimated Effort

0.1 days (part of 0.5 days for all of Phase 4)

## Solution Design

1. Approach 1: Manual verification
   - Description: Carefully read both files and compare each section
   - Pros: Thorough, detailed review
   - Cons: Time-consuming, prone to oversight
   - Technical considerations: Requires deep understanding of rule structure requirements

2. Approach 2: Use Sequential Thinking with vibe-tools assistance
   - Description: Use structured thinking to break down verification steps and use vibe-tools to assist
   - Pros: Structured, thorough, leverages AI assistance
   - Cons: May still require manual review of some elements
   - Technical considerations: Ensures all components are checked systematically

## Implementation

- [x] Generate a verification plan using vibe-tools
  - [x] Identify all sections to verify
  - [x] Create a structured approach to verification
  - Success criteria: Comprehensive verification plan covering all aspects
  - Dependencies: Access to both files

- [x] Review and verify frontmatter section
  - [x] Check description follows "VERB when CONTEXT to OUTCOME" pattern
  - [x] Verify globs patterns are correctly specified
  - [x] Check alwaysApply setting is appropriate
  - Success criteria: Frontmatter complies with standards
  - Dependencies: Access to cursor-rules-creation.mdc standards

- [x] Review and verify rule block structure
  - [x] Verify name uses proper snake_case
  - [x] Check all required elements are present
  - [x] Validate internal links use mdc: syntax
  - [x] Verify examples section has proper input-output pairs
  - Success criteria: All rule block elements comply with standards
  - Dependencies: Access to cursor-rules-creation.mdc standards

- [x] Update metadata section if needed
  - [x] Remove non-standard fields to conform to guidelines
  - Success criteria: Metadata section follows cursor-rules-creation.mdc standards
  - Dependencies: Understanding of correct metadata structure

## Notes

This is a validation step to ensure the rule maintains high quality and consistency with other rules.

Upon review, the ai-agile-workflow.mdc file was found to conform very well to the cursor-rules-creation.mdc guidelines. The following aspects were verified:

1. Frontmatter correctly follows the "VERB when CONTEXT to OUTCOME" pattern
2. Globs patterns are properly specified and unquoted
3. alwaysApply is set to false as appropriate
4. Rule name uses proper snake_case format
5. Rule block contains all required elements (name, description, filters, actions, examples, metadata)
6. All internal links use the mdc: syntax
7. Examples section includes well-structured input-output pairs

One improvement was made to the file: removed the non-standard 'changelog' and 'last_updated' fields from the metadata section to conform to the cursor-rules-creation.mdc standards, which only specify priority, version, and tags as standard metadata fields.

## Analysis Findings

The detailed review of ai-agile-workflow.mdc revealed the following:

- The rule structure generally follows cursor-rules-creation.mdc very well
- All required sections are present and properly formatted
- The frontmatter correctly implements the "VERB when CONTEXT to OUTCOME" pattern
- Internal links correctly use the mdc: syntax for cross-references
- Examples section contains well-structured input-output pairs

The only deviation found was in the metadata section, which included non-standard 'changelog' and 'last_updated' fields that are not part of the standard metadata structure defined in cursor-rules-creation.mdc. These fields were removed to ensure full compliance.
