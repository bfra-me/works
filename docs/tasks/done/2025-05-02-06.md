# Task: Perform Workflow Gap Analysis

## Task ID: 2025-05-02-06

## Related Plan

[Develop Rules for Missing Critical Workflows](../plans/develop-missing-cursor-rules.md)

## Description

Analyze the current workflow coverage in the repository to identify gaps where critical development practices are not yet covered by Cursor rules. Inventory all existing rules, compare them against the list of critical workflows (testing, CI/CD, dependency management, API design, debugging, code review), and document which areas lack dedicated rules. Prioritize the missing rules based on workflow importance and pain points. Document findings in a gap analysis report.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive inventory of existing workflow coverage
- Identification of critical gaps in guidance
- Documentation of pain points and common issues
- Analysis of support ticket/question frequency (if available)
- Prioritized list of needed workflow rules
- Gap analysis report created in docs/memory/

## Dependencies

- None

## Complexity

Medium

## Estimated Effort

1-2 days

## Status

Completed

## Assignee

Unassigned

## Notes

- Use the ai-agile-workflow.mdc and develop-missing-workflow-rules.md as primary references
- Coordinate with subject matter experts if needed
- The gap analysis report should be named 'workflow-gap-analysis.md' and placed in docs/memory/

## Implementation

✓ Created comprehensive inventory of existing workflow-related Cursor rules
✓ Identified six critical workflow gaps without dedicated rules
✓ Documented specific pain points and common issues for each gap
✓ Analyzed frequency of issues to inform prioritization
✓ Created prioritized list of needed rules with rationale
✓ Generated workflow-gap-analysis.md report in docs/memory directory
✓ Added Knowledge Graph integration section to bridge workflow gaps
✓ Outlined next steps for rule creation and implementation

## History

- 2025-05-16: Task verified and marked as completed. All acceptance criteria have been met with the creation of the workflow-gap-analysis.md file in the docs/memory directory. The report includes a comprehensive inventory of existing workflow coverage, identifies six critical workflow gaps, documents pain points, analyzes issue frequency, provides a prioritized list of needed rules, and includes Knowledge Graph integration guidance. The document was last updated on 2025-05-02, indicating the work was completed then but not properly marked in the tracking system.
