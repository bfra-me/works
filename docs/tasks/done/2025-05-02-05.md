## Notes

According to the workflow status, there's already a plan for version control metadata in Cursor rules that includes:

- Inventory all .mdc files in .cursor/rules/
- Ensure a YAML metadata block (with priority, version, tags, changelog) is present at the end of the <rule> block
- Update or add metadata blocks as needed
- Update cursor-rules-creation.mdc
- Document changes in changelogs

This task will implement this plan.

## Progress Updates

- Created version control template at `docs/templates/version-control-template.md` (2025-05-02)
- Updated cursor-rules-creation.mdc to include metadata guidelines and examples (2025-05-02)
- Added metadata section to cursor-rules-creation.mdc at version 1.1 (2025-05-02)
- Created script at `scripts/check-rule-metadata.sh` to inventory rules and check for metadata (2025-05-02)
- Ran inventory script to identify rules missing metadata sections (2025-05-02)
- Verified implementation: All acceptance criteria have been met. The check-rule-metadata.sh script identifies vibe-tools.mdc and 00-rule-index.mdc as missing metadata, but both are exempt by design - 00-rule-index.mdc as it's not a traditional rule, and vibe-tools.mdc as clarified by user directive that it should not be modified without explicit instructions. (2025-05-16)
- Completed task with all applicable rules now having consistent metadata blocks. (2025-05-16)
