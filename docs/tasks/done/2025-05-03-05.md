[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Create a comprehensive rule format template that establishes a standardized structure for all Cursor rules. This template will define the required and optional sections for each rule, specify formatting guidelines, and provide example content for each section. The template should accommodate different rule types (auto-attached, agent requested, always applied, and manual) while ensuring consistent structure and presentation.

The template should serve as a reference for rule creators and maintainers, promoting consistency across the rule ecosystem and simplifying the process of creating new rules.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Standard sections defined for all rule types, including:
  - Frontmatter (name, description, filters, etc.)
  - Overview/introduction
  - Rule structure guidelines
  - Example section with input/output patterns
  - Action blocks
  - Metadata section
- Example content provided for each section
- Clear formatting guidelines for:
  - Headings and subheadings
  - Code blocks and inline code
  - Lists and tables
  - Links and cross-references
- Template documentation with:
  - Section purpose explanations
  - Optional vs. required sections
  - Best practices for each section
- Clear examples of the four rule application types:
  - Auto-attached rules (triggered by file types)
  - Agent-requested rules (requested based on context)
  - Always-applied rules (global application)
  - Manual rules (explicit inclusion)
