# Task: Standardize Cursor Rule Description Patterns

## Task ID: 2025-05-04-01

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

This task involves standardizing the description field in the frontmatter of all Cursor rules to follow the consistent "VERB when CONTEXT to OUTCOME" pattern.

Currently, some rules have descriptions that don't follow this pattern, which may reduce the effectiveness of conditional rule application by AI assistants. In particular, verbs like "DOCUMENT" may not align with how rules are used by AI assistants and should be replaced with more appropriate verbs like "APPLY" or "FOLLOW" that better indicate when and how the rule should be activated.

The primary goal is to ensure all rules have descriptions that clearly indicate:

1. An appropriate ACTION verb (APPLY, FOLLOW, USE, etc.)
2. A specific CONTEXT when the rule applies
3. A clear OUTCOME or purpose

This standardization will improve the AI assistant's ability to conditionally select the appropriate rules for a given conversation context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` have been reviewed
- Each rule's description field in the frontmatter follows the "VERB when CONTEXT to OUTCOME" pattern
- Inappropriate or unclear verbs (like "DOCUMENT") have been replaced with more suitable alternatives
- Rule descriptions in both frontmatter and the rule index are consistent
- For any updated rules, the rule index has been updated to match
- Documentation capturing the rationale for any significant verb changes has been created
- All modified files have been verified to ensure proper formatting and structure

## Dependencies

- Cursor Rules System Improvements plan (Phase 2)
- Rule format template (established but may need refinement)

## Complexity

Medium

## Estimated Effort

4 hours

## Status

[Completed]

## Notes

- Priority should be given to rules that are frequently used or referenced by other rules
- When updating rule descriptions, the following verb guidelines should be considered:
  - Use "APPLY" for rules that guide direct implementation or application of standards
  - Use "FOLLOW" for rules that outline processes or workflows
  - Use "USE" for rules that provide syntax or structural guidance
  - Use "IMPLEMENT" for rules about feature or component creation
  - Use "MAINTAIN" for rules about ongoing management or upkeep
  - Avoid verbs that don't relate to how rules are activated or applied (e.g., "DOCUMENT")
- For the rule-acknowledgement rule specifically, change from "DOCUMENT when APPLYING rules" to "APPLY when RESPONDING to ENSURE transparency and traceability"
- Keep a record of all changes made for future reference and to aid in documenting patterns
- All changes should be made using proper frontmatter editing techniques (terminal commands) to avoid formatting issues

## Progress (2025-05-04)

The following rules have been updated:

1. rule-acknowledgement.mdc: "APPLY when RESPONDING to ENSURE transparency and traceability"
2. typescript-patterns.mdc: "APPLY when WRITING TypeScript to MAINTAIN code quality standards"
3. ai-agile-workflow.mdc: "IMPLEMENT when MANAGING tasks to STREAMLINE progress tracking"
4. date-consistency-enforcer.mdc: "USE when HANDLING dates to PREVENT inconsistencies in timestamps"
5. 00-rule-index.mdc: Changed "NAVIGATE" to "USE when EXPLORING rules to DISCOVER applicable guidance"
6. api-design-standards.mdc: Changed "ADHERE" to "FOLLOW when DESIGNING APIs to ENSURE consistency and type safety"
7. ci-cd-workflow.mdc: Changed "CONSULT" to "USE when TROUBLESHOOTING CI/CD issues to RESOLVE build failures"
8. cursor-rules-location.mdc: Changed "PLACE" to "FOLLOW when CREATING rule files to GUARANTEE proper rule organization"
9. debugging-guide.mdc: Changed "CONSULT" to "USE when DEBUGGING issues to RESOLVE problems efficiently"
10. eslint-config-usage.mdc: Changed "CONFIGURE" to "FOLLOW when SETTING UP ESLint to ENFORCE consistent code style"
11. mcp-tools-usage.mdc: Changed "LEVERAGE" to "USE when REQUIRING external context to ENHANCE AI capabilities"
12. monorepo-structure.mdc: Changed "REFERENCE" to "USE when NAVIGATING the monorepo to UNDERSTAND package relationships"
13. repo-analyzer.mdc: Changed "UTILIZE" to "USE when ANALYZING repository structure to LOCATE specific code"
14. rule-automation-script.mdc: Changed "UTILIZE" to "USE when AUTOMATING rule management to INCREASE efficiency"
15. user-preferences-awareness.mdc: Changed "ALIGN" to "APPLY when PROVIDING assistance to MATCH established user preferences"

All 17 rule files that needed verb standardization have been updated (including "STRUCTURE" for the Anthropic Chain of Thought rule, which was retained due to its specific nature regarding reasoning structure).

### Notes on Verb Selection

- "FOLLOW" was chosen for rules that provide procedural guidance or standards to adhere to
- "USE" was chosen for rules that provide tools, syntax, or guidance for specific tasks
- "APPLY" was chosen for rules that guide direct implementation of standards
- "IMPLEMENT" was chosen for rules about feature or component creation

The updated verbs better represent how Cursor rules are activated and used by AI assistants.

### Rationale for Specific Verb Choices

- Replaced "ADHERE" with "FOLLOW" as it better represents following a process or guideline
- Replaced "CONSULT", "REFERENCE", and "LEVERAGE" with "USE" as they all involve using a resource
- Replaced "UTILIZE" with "USE" as it's simpler and more direct
- Replaced "CONFIGURE" with "FOLLOW" for configuration guidelines
- Replaced "PLACE" with "FOLLOW" for location rules
- Replaced "ALIGN" with "APPLY" for implementation guidance

The task is now complete, with all rule descriptions in the frontmatter following the standardized "VERB when CONTEXT to OUTCOME" pattern using the recommended verbs.
