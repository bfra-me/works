# Task: Create Showcase File for Vibe-Tools Examples

## Task ID: 2025-05-07-03

## Related Plan

[Vibe-Tools Playbook Integration Plan](/docs/plans/vibe-tools-playbook-integration.md)

## Description

Create a comprehensive showcase file in docs/memory/ that provides practical, real-world examples of vibe-tools usage across different scenarios. This file will serve as a companion to the vibe-tools-playbook.md, demonstrating concrete applications of each command.

## Problem Analysis

- While the vibe-tools-playbook.md provides detailed documentation, users benefit from seeing concrete examples in context
- New users need to understand how commands can be applied to common development tasks
- Showcasing the power of vibe-tools requires demonstrating it solving real problems
- Examples need to cover a variety of workflows and use cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- Create vibe-tools-showcase.md in docs/memory/ following memory file standards
- Include at least 3 practical examples for each major vibe-tools command (web, repo, plan, doc, browser, mcp)
- Each example should include:
  - The problem being solved
  - The complete command with all necessary arguments
  - Expected output/result
  - Explanation of when and why to use this approach
- Organize examples by command type and use case
- Add proper memory file timestamps and formats
- Cross-reference with vibe-tools-playbook.md and other relevant documentation
- Ensure examples align with current vibe-tools capabilities (v0.60+)

## Complexity

Medium

## Estimated Effort

1-2 days

## Solution Design

1. Option 1: Create a single comprehensive showcase file
   - Pros: All examples in one place, easier to maintain
   - Cons: Could become lengthy
   - Technical considerations: Needs clear organization to remain usable

2. Option 2: Create multiple showcase files by command type
   - Pros: More focused, easier to navigate
   - Cons: Scattered information, harder to discover
   - Technical considerations: Would require robust cross-referencing
