## Progress on Addressing Review Feedback (2025-05-16)

As per the user request to work on this task, several review findings detailed in the "Implementation" section below (which serves as the initial review document) were addressed by modifying the `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule file. The following actions were taken:

1.  **Memory File Automation Section in `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` Updated**:
    - Added notes to existing Sprint Planning and Retrospective Insights examples to consult `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md` for more specific patterns: `*(Ensure these examples align with any specific patterns in docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md if available, or customize them as needed.)*`.
    - Added new subsection: "Guidance on Automation Script Lifecycle Integration".
    - Added a conceptual example for Knowledge Graph updates using `vibe-tools mcp run` and the temporary file method.
    - Added an example for handling complex/multi-line prompts in automation scripts using `vibe-tools repo` and the temporary file method.

2.  **Command Example Accuracy and Clarity in `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` Addressed**:
    - Added an "Important Note on `--with-doc`" to clarify its correct usage and specifically state that it's NOT supported by `vibe-tools web`.

3.  **Rule Structure and Formatting in `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` Enhanced**:
    - Reinforced date guidance by adding a note in the "Task Generation" section to consult `date-consistency-enforcer.mdc`.

**`vibe-tools repo` Review Outcome:**

A `vibe-tools repo` command was executed to review these changes. The review confirmed that:

- The KG update example, complex prompt handling example, `vibe-tools web --with-doc` clarification, and date guidance reference were **successfully addressed**.
- The primary remaining gap noted by the `vibe-tools repo` review is that the script examples for "Sprint Planning Integration" and "Retrospective Insights Processing" in `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` are still considered single commands and may not fully reflect the more comprehensive, multi-step script examples potentially detailed in `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md`. Access to `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md` would be needed to fully align these specific script examples if they differ.

**Blockers:**

User has confirmed that the prerequisite tasks (`2025-05-06-13`, `2025-05-06-14`, `2025-05-06-15`) are completed. This task is no longer blocked by them.

## Final Implementation Updates (2025-05-16)

Based on a detailed analysis using `vibe-tools repo` to examine the script examples in `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md`, the following final improvements were made to the `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule file:

1. **Comprehensive Script Examples Added:**
   - **Sprint Planning Integration**: Replaced the simple single-command example with a complete multi-step script that:
     - Sets up sprint variables
     - Generates raw plan content using `vibe-tools plan` with a temporary file for the prompt
     - Formats the raw plan into a structured Markdown document using `vibe-tools ask`
     - Manages temporary files properly
     - Saves the formatted plan to the appropriate directory

   - **Retrospective Insights Processing**: Replaced the simple single-command example with a comprehensive multi-step script that:
     - Sets up sprint variables and prepares retrospective note files
     - Processes retrospective notes to extract insights using `vibe-tools ask` with temporary files for prompts
     - Appends insights to a central retrospective history file
     - Generates actionable tasks from the insights
     - Manages all temporary files appropriately

2. **Best Practices Implementation:**
   - All examples now use the temporary file method for complex prompts as recommended in `vibe-tools.mdc` and `self-improvement.mdc`
   - Added detailed comments explaining each step of the scripts
   - Included proper date handling references to `date-consistency-enforcer.mdc`
   - Demonstrated proper file management techniques

3. **Rule Metadata Update:**
   - Incremented the version number from `3.0.0` to `3.1.0` to reflect these enhancements

These changes ensure that the `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule now fully aligns with the comprehensive script examples in `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md` and addresses all the review findings in the original implementation section of this task.

## Implementation

### Review Findings Summary

A thorough review of the `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule, performed on 2025-05-15, has identified that while the rule has been significantly enhanced with `vibe-tools` integration, there are several areas requiring attention before it can be considered fully complete. The current status is **Largely Complete** but requires specific refinements.

### 1. Vibe-Tools Integration Completeness

**Status:** LARGELY COMPLETE

**Strengths:**

- Integration of `vibe-tools` across all major workflow stages
- Clear command examples for most scenarios
- Comprehensive integration in Feature Definition, Plan Creation, Task Generation, and Task Execution stages

**Areas Requiring Attention:**

- **Memory File Automation Section:**
  - Missing script examples for "Sprint Planning Integration" and "Retrospective Insights Processing" from `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md`
  - Need for clearer guidance on how automation scripts fit into the workflow lifecycle
  - Lack of explicit examples for Knowledge Graph updates via `vibe-tools mcp run` in memory automation scripts

### 2. Command Example Accuracy and Clarity

**Status:** NEEDS REFINEMENT

**Issues Found:**

- Incorrect usage of `--with-doc` with `vibe-tools web` (option only supported by `ask`, `plan`, `repo`, and `doc` commands)
- Fragile approach to handling complex/multi-line prompts in shell commands (especially in automation script examples)
- Lack of explicit examples using the temporary file method for complex prompts as recommended in `vibe-tools.mdc` and reinforced by `self-improvement.mdc`

**Recommendations:**

- Correct `--with-doc` usage to align with supported commands
- Add examples using the temporary file method for handling complex prompts in scripts:
  ```bash
  PROMPT_TEXT="Update the workflow-status.md memory file with..."
  TMP_FILE=$(mktemp)
  echo -e "$PROMPT_TEXT" > "$TMP_FILE"
  vibe-tools ask "$(cat "$TMP_FILE")" --save-to=workflow-status-updates.md
  rm "$TMP_FILE"
  ```

### 3. Rule Structure and Formatting

**Status:** STRONG BUT NEEDS MINOR UPDATES

**Strengths:**

- Well-organized structure with logical sections
- Consistent formatting of headings, lists, code blocks
- Proper use of `mdc:` links
- Comprehensive examples section

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Need for reinforced guidance on obtaining dates per `date-consistency-enforcer.mdc` near template examples

### 4. Prerequisites Status

**Critical Issue:** The prerequisite tasks for this final review have not been started:

- Task `2025-05-06-13` (Add/Update Cross-References) - Status: Not Started
- Task `2025-05-06-14` (Ensure Rule Structure Compliance) - Status: Not Started
- Task `2025-05-06-15` (Update Rule Metadata) - Status: Not Started

### Recommendations for Completion

1. **Complete the prerequisite tasks first** (2025-05-06-13, 14, and 15)
2. Address the specific issues identified in this review:
   - Add missing script examples for Sprint Planning and Retrospective Insights
   - Correct `--with-doc` usage with `vibe-tools` commands
   - Add examples using the temporary file method for complex prompts
   - Reinforce date retrieval guidance where appropriate
3. Perform a final verification after all changes to ensure consistency
4. Update the status of this task to "Completed" once all refinements are implemented

This review provides a solid foundation for finalizing the `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule and completing the Vibe-Tools integration.
