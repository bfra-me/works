# Task: Integrate Vibe-Tools for Task Generation

## Task ID: 2025-05-06-07

## Related Plan

[Vibe-Tools Integration Plan](mdc:docs/plans/vibe-tools-integration-plan.md)

## Description

Integrate the `vibe-tools plan` and `vibe-tools repo` commands into the `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule to facilitate effective and context-aware task generation.

## Implementation Sub-Plan

### 1. Content Creation for `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc`

**1.1. Draft Explanation for Task Generation in `ai-agile-workflow.mdc`**

- Locate the "### Step 3: Generate Task Documents" section in `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc`.
- Introduce `vibe-tools plan` and `vibe-tools repo` as enhanced methods for task generation.
- **Refined Example Snippet (incorporating Gemini's feedback for clarity and better examples):**

  ````markdown
  ### Step 3: Generate Task Documents

  When you have a plan document open, you can ask the AI to generate task documents (e.g., "Generate task documents from this plan").
  **Before creating a new task document, you MUST check the `docs/tasks/` directory for existing task files for the current date...** (existing text)

  For more structured and context-aware task breakdown, leverage `vibe-tools`:

  #### Task Generation with Vibe-Tools

  Using `vibe-tools` can provide more context-aware and structured task generation:

  - **Using `vibe-tools plan` for Task Breakdown:**
    `vibe-tools plan` can analyze a feature's objectives or a plan document to automatically suggest a breakdown into specific tasks.
    ```bash
    # Example: Break down a feature specified in a plan document
    vibe-tools plan "From the plan in docs/plans/my-feature-plan.md, generate actionable tasks for the frontend implementation phase."

    # Example: Save output directly to a task file (useful for initial task creation)
    vibe-tools plan "Break down the 'User Authentication' feature into tasks" --save-to=docs/tasks/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-01.md
  ````

  _(Ensure the date command usage aligns with `date-consistency-enforcer.mdc` if used directly in rules, or prefer AI to generate full task IDs.)_
  - **Using `vibe-tools repo` for Code-Aware Task Definition:** `vibe-tools repo` offers contextual insights by leveraging the existing repository structure, helping to define tasks based on current code.

    ```bash
    # Example: Define tasks based on codebase structure for a refactoring effort
    vibe-tools repo "For the refactoring plan of the 'SettingsModule', identify tasks needed to update its dependencies in 'ProfileComponent' and 'AdminPanel'."

    # Example: Break down implementation based on current rule structures
    vibe-tools repo "Break down the implementation of cross-references into discrete tasks based on the current structure of Cursor rules. Consider file paths, parsing requirements, and rendering approaches."
    ```

    These commands ensure that task generation is informed by both the broader feature context and the specific details of the codebase. Refer to [vibe-tools](mdc:.cursor/rules/vibe-tools.mdc) for more command details.

  ```

  ```

**1.2. Identify and Incorporate Additional Command Examples (if necessary)**

- Review `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md` (if it exists and contains further distinct examples for _task generation_) and the `vibe-tools` rule itself for any other highly relevant examples for `vibe-tools plan` and `vibe-tools repo` in the context of _breaking down work into tasks_.
- Integrate them if they add significant value beyond the examples above.

**1.3. Ensure Smooth Integration**

- Verify the new content integrates logically within the existing "Generate Task Documents" section.
- Maintain consistent formatting (headings, code blocks, lists) with the rest of `ai-agile-workflow.mdc`.

### 2. Implementation/Execution in `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc`

**2.1. Edit `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc`**

- Apply the drafted content from section 1.1 into the "Generate Task Documents" section.

**2.2. Maintain Accuracy and Adherence to Standards**

- Ensure compliance with `.cursor/rules/cursor-rules-creation.mdc`:
  - Clear, actionable language.
  - Correct and consistent formatting.
  - Useful and accurate examples.
  - Proper `mdc:` link syntax.

### 3. Verification and Completion

**3.1. Review Changes in `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc`**

- Check the modified section for clarity, correctness, and completeness.
- Verify all command examples are accurate.
- Ensure formatting is consistent.

**3.2. Update Rule Metadata in `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc`**

- Increment the `version` number (e.g., from `2.0` to `2.1`, or `X.Y` to `X.Y+1`).

**3.3. Add/Verify Cross-References in `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc`**

- Ensure the explicit link `[vibe-tools](mdc:.cursor/rules/vibe-tools.mdc)` is present in the new content.
- Update the "Related Rules" section of `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` if `vibe-tools.mdc` is not already listed or if the relationship needs more clarity.

**3.4. Update `docs/memory/workflow-status.md` (Initial Update)**

- Modify `docs/memory/workflow-status.md` to reflect task `2025-05-06-07` as active:
  - Under `## Current State` -> `- **Active Tasks**:` add/ensure the following line is present:
    ```markdown
    - Integrate `vibe-tools plan` / `repo` for Task Generation (Task ID: 2025-05-06-07) - Vibe-Tools Integration
    ```
  - Add to `## Recent Updates`:
    ```markdown
    - Started task 2025-05-06-07: Integrate `vibe-tools plan` / `repo` for Task Generation into `ai-agile-workflow.mdc`. (2025-05-06)
    ```
- Update the main `## Updated: YYYY-MM-DD` timestamp at the end of `workflow-status.md`.

**3.5. (Self-Correction/Post-Implementation) Review with `vibe-tools repo`** - After applying changes to `ai-agile-workflow.mdc`, use `vibe-tools repo "Review the recent changes made to .cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc regarding the integration of vibe-tools for task generation. Check for adherence to the plan in docs/tasks/2025-05-06-07.md, clarity, and correctness." --with-doc=docs/tasks/2025-05-06-07.md` (again, passing doc content via variable if needed).

**3.6. Update `docs/memory/workflow-status.md` (Final Update upon Task Completion)**

- Once all implementation and review steps are complete:
  - Remove the task from `- **Active Tasks**:`
  - Add to `| Task ID       | Task Name                                     | Status    | Completion Date |` table:
    ```markdown
    | 2025-05-06-07 | Integrate `vibe-tools plan` / `repo` for Task Generation | Completed | 2025-05-06      |
    ```
  - Add to `## Recent Updates`:
    ```markdown
    - Completed task 2025-05-06-07: Integrated `vibe-tools plan` / `repo` for Task Generation into `ai-agile-workflow.mdc`. (2025-05-06)
    ```
- Update the main `## Updated: YYYY-MM-DD` timestamp at the end of `workflow-status.md`.

**3.7. Final Task File Management**

- Move this task file `docs/tasks/2025-05-06-07.md` to `docs/tasks/done/`.

## Notes

Ensure compliance with `.cursor/rules/cursor-rules-creation.mdc` for all modifications to rule files. Pay close attention to the integration strategy to ensure `vibe-tools` usage is presented as a clear enhancement. Refer to `docs/memory/workflow-status.md` for current date and `docs/plans/vibe-tools-integration-plan.md` for overall context. The `docs/memory/agile-workflow-enhancements.md` file should be consulted for example commands if it exists and provides value not covered by Gemini's suggestions.
