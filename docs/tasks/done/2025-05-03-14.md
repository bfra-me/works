# Task: Prioritize rule application

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Develop a system for prioritizing rule application when multiple rules apply to the same context. This task involves creating clear guidelines for determining which rules take precedence in different situations, documenting priority levels, and establishing a hierarchy for rule application. The guidance should help AI assistants and developers understand how to resolve conflicts when multiple rules are applicable.

Prioritizing rule application will improve the predictability of rule behavior, reduce confusion when multiple rules apply, and ensure that the most relevant guidance is surfaced in any given context.

## Problem Description

The Cursor rules system lacked clear guidelines for determining which rules should take precedence when multiple rules could potentially apply to the same context. This ambiguity could lead to unpredictable behavior, conflicting guidance, or surfacing of overly generic rules when more specific ones would be more appropriate. Without a defined priority system, AI assistants would have to make arbitrary decisions about which rules to apply when conflicts arose.

## Solution Implemented

A comprehensive rule prioritization system was added to the `cursor-rules-creation.mdc` file, establishing a clear hierarchy for rule application:

1. Explicit user invocation takes the highest priority
2. Rules with `alwaysApply: true` are always considered active
3. Filter specificity determines priority (file path > glob pattern > file extension > content > message)
4. The metadata `priority` field (high/medium/low) acts as a tie-breaker
5. AI judgment synthesizes information from complementary rules

The solution included detailed explanations of each level in the hierarchy, examples of conflict resolution scenarios, and guidance on documenting priority in rule metadata.

## Implementation Details

The implementation involved:

1. Creating a new section in `cursor-rules-creation.mdc` titled "Rule Prioritization and Conflict Resolution"
2. Defining a clear 5-level hierarchy for prioritization
3. Providing three specific examples illustrating how the prioritization works in different scenarios
4. Adding guidance on when and how to use the `priority` metadata field
5. Creating a placeholder link to the future "Conflict Resolution Guidance" document
6. Updating the domain-knowledge.md file to include the new concept
7. Adding a new implementation pattern for rule prioritization

The solution is now documented in the cursor-rules-creation.mdc file, which serves as the primary reference for rule creation and management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Clear definition of priority levels for rules
- Rule hierarchy that establishes which types of rules take precedence
- Guidelines for applying priority in different contexts
- Documentation of how rule metadata affects priority
- Explanation of how rule type influences priority
- Examples of priority application in common conflict scenarios
- Documentation of override mechanisms when needed
- Clear guidance on how to indicate priority in rule metadata

## Dependencies

- Add conflict resolution guidance (Task ID: 2025-05-03-10)

## Caveats and Limitations

- The prioritization system still requires AI judgment for complex scenarios
- The system assumes rules are properly tagged with relevant metadata
- Very similar contexts might still produce ambiguous priority
- The prioritization doesn't consider rule version or recency
- Complementary rules might still need to be synthesized rather than having one take complete precedence

## Notes

- Focus on practical guidance rather than complex algorithms
- Consider both rule type and content when determining priority
- Provide clear examples of priority resolution
- Document how specificity impacts priority
- Remember that the goal is to surface the most relevant context to AI assistants
- Keep priority systems simple and understandable
