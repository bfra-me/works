# Task: Document rule interaction patterns

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-15

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Document common patterns of interaction between different Cursor rules, identifying how rules can complement each other, potentially conflict, or be used together to provide comprehensive guidance. This task involves analyzing existing rules to identify patterns of interaction, documenting common combinations, and providing guidance on how to design rules that work well together.

Understanding how rules interact will help rule creators design more effective rules, reduce unintended conflicts, and enable AI assistants to better integrate guidance from multiple applicable rules in a coherent way.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation of common rule interaction patterns
- Identification of complementary rule combinations
- Analysis of potential conflict patterns between rules
- Best practices for designing rules that work well together
- Examples of effective rule combinations
- Documentation of anti-patterns to avoid
- Guidelines for cross-referencing between related rules
- Suggestions for rule grouping by related functionality

## Dependencies

- Add conflict resolution guidance (Task ID: 2025-05-03-10)
- Prioritize rule application (Task ID: 2025-05-03-14)

## Notes

- Focus on practical patterns rather than theoretical interactions
- Document real examples of rule interactions from the current rule set
- Consider both intentional and unintentional interactions
- Identify patterns where rules naturally complement each other
- Document how to use cross-references to enhance rule relationships
- Remember that the goal is cohesive guidance for AI assistants

### Implementation Details

- Created a new memory file `docs/memory/rule-interactions.md` to document rule interaction patterns
- Analyzed existing rules in `.cursor/rules/` directory to identify common patterns
- Structured documentation into sections covering:
  - Interaction Categories (Synergy, Foundation, Layering, Conflict/Overlap)
  - Common Interaction Patterns (Workflow Synergy, Coding Standards Stack, etc.)
  - Potential Conflict Areas & Resolution strategies
  - Best Practices for designing interacting rules
  - Examples of effective rule combinations
  - Anti-patterns to avoid
  - Guidelines for cross-referencing
- Updated domain knowledge with a new "Rule Interaction Documentation Pattern"
- Added technical decision about documenting rule interactions in a dedicated memory file
- Used `cursor-rule-cross-references.mdc` guidelines for all internal links

### Solution Highlights

- Comprehensive documentation of how rules complement each other, potentially conflict, or work together
- Clear resolution strategies for potential rule conflicts
- Practical examples illustrating effective rule combinations in real scenarios
- Concrete anti-patterns to avoid when designing new rules

### Caveats and Limitations

- The interaction documentation is based on the current rule set and will need maintenance as rules evolve
- Conflict resolution relies on AI interpretation based on priority and specificity
- Some interaction patterns may emerge only as more rules are created and used together
