# Task: Update Cursor Rule Index and Cross-References

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-04

## Related Plan

[Develop Rules for Missing Critical Cursor Rules](../plans/develop-missing-cursor-rules.md)

## Description

As part of the Cursor Rules System Improvements plan (Phase 2-3), the rule registry (`00-rule-index.mdc`) needs to be updated to include all new rules. Additionally, cross-references between rules should be established to create a navigable knowledge graph.

This task should focus on:

1. Auditing all rules to identify relationships
2. Adding explicit `Relates to:` sections with `mdc:` links in all rules
3. Updating the rule index with proper categorization
4. Creating a visual relationship diagram

## Problem Analysis

- New workflow rules need integration into the rule index
- Many rules lack proper bidirectional cross-references
- The rule relationship diagram needs updating
- Reference validity needs verification
- Connections between rules are not always clear

## Acceptance Criteria

- Addition of all new rules to rule index
- Creation of bidirectional cross-references
- Updated rule relationship diagram
- Documentation of rule connections
- Verification of reference validity

## Complexity

Medium

## Estimated Effort

1 day

## Solution Design

1. Manual cross-reference approach:
   - Manually review each rule for connection points
   - Add cross-references based on content analysis
   - Pros: Highly accurate, contextual references
   - Cons: Time-consuming, may miss some connections

2. Automated analysis approach:
   - Use NLP/keyword analysis to identify related concepts
   - Generate suggested cross-references
   - Manually verify and implement
   - Pros: More efficient initial discovery
   - Cons: Requires additional verification

## Implementation

- [ ] Update rule index
  - [ ] Add entries for all new workflow rules
  - [ ] Ensure metadata is consistent
  - Success criteria: Complete index with all rules
  - Dependencies: Completion of new workflow rules

- [ ] Create bidirectional cross-references
  - [ ] Implement references using proper mdc: syntax
  - [ ] Ensure context for each reference
  - Success criteria: Comprehensive cross-references
  - Dependencies: Relationship map

- [ ] Update rule relationship diagram
  - [ ] Add new workflow rules
  - [ ] Update connections
  - [ ] Ensure diagram reflects current structure
  - Success criteria: Accurate visual representation
  - Dependencies: Updated index and cross-references

- [ ] Verify reference validity
  - [ ] Check all links for correct paths
  - [ ] Ensure proper mdc: syntax throughout
  - [ ] Test navigation between rules
  - Success criteria: All references working correctly
  - Dependencies: Cross-reference implementation

## Assignee

Unassigned

## Notes

This task is a critical integration step that will tie together all the Cursor rules developed in previous phases. Special attention should be paid to ensuring that the relationship diagram accurately reflects the logical connections between Cursor rules. All cross-references must use the proper mdc: syntax as defined in the cursor-rule-cross-references rule.

- The standard format for cross-references is `[rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc)`
- All rules should have a "Related Rules" section
- Rules should be categorized consistently across the index and relationship diagram
- Bidirectional relationships should be explicitly marked
- The rule index should serve as the central entry point for rule discovery

## Analysis Findings

### Summary

All 24 cursor rules have been analyzed using the rule-relationship-analysis framework. The analysis reveals a sophisticated and well-designed rule ecosystem with strong interconnectivity among rules. Key patterns identified include:

1. **Foundational Rules**: `cursor-rules-creation`, `date-consistency-enforcer`, and `memory-management` serve as foundational building blocks that many other rules depend on for basic structure, formatting, and workflow principles.

2. **Workflow Chains**: Strong sequential relationships exist within the development workflow rules (`development-workflow`, `ai-agile-workflow`, `changeset-workflow`, `ci-cd-workflow`), forming interconnected processes.

3. **Tool Integrations**: Many rules explicitly rely on external tools or internal utilities, highlighting which rules provide context for using specific tools.

4. **Standards Enforcement**: Rules defining standards (`typescript-patterns`, `api-design-standards`, `eslint-config-usage`) frequently relate to each other and to workflow rules, indicating standards are applied across processes.

5. **Memory/Context Integration**: Memory management rules (`memory-management`, `user-preferences-awareness`) are central hubs connecting to many other rules that either provide or consume context.

6. **Bidirectional Links**: Many relationships flow both ways between rules, requiring explicit bidirectional references in the implementation.

### Next Steps

To complete this task successfully, we need to:

1. **Implement Bidirectional Cross-References**: Add the documented "Relates to" links in the "Related Rules" section of each rule, ensuring correct `mdc:` syntax. For bidirectional relationships, add corresponding links in both related rules.

2. **Update the Rule Index**: Update `00-rule-index.mdc` to incorporate all rules, ensuring proper categorization and metadata accuracy.

3. **Create/Update Rule Relationship Diagram**: Develop a visual representation of the rule ecosystem showing the primary connections.

4. **Verify Reference Validity**: Test all `mdc:` links to ensure they point to valid file paths.

5. **Mark Task as Completed**: Update task status and move the file to the done directory upon completion.

## Dependencies

- Cursor Rules Creation guide (for proper syntax and formatting)
- All existing .mdc rule files (as sources for analysis)
- Completion of Phases 2 and 3 workflow rules
