# Task: Enhance rule creation guidance

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-12

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Improve the guidance for creating new Cursor rules by updating the cursor-rules-creation rule with clearer instructions, better examples, and more comprehensive best practices. This task involves revising the existing guidance to ensure it reflects our current understanding of Cursor rules as contextual documents for AI assistants (not application features), provides clearer direction on rule structure and content, and helps rule creators avoid common pitfalls.

The enhanced guidance will make it easier for contributors to create high-quality rules that follow best practices, maintain consistency across the rule ecosystem, and provide valuable context to AI assistants.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Updated cursor-rules-creation rule with:
  - Clear step-by-step process for creating new rules
  - Improved examples of well-structured rules
  - Detailed explanation of frontmatter options and their effects
  - Best practices for writing effective rule content
  - Guidelines for creating useful examples
  - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Example templates for different rule types
- Guidelines for writing effective rule descriptions
- Clear explanation of the purpose of rules as contextual documents
- Updated guidance that explicitly differentiates rules from application features
- Improved explanation of rule activation conditions
