# Task: Consolidate overlapping rules

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-07

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Identify and consolidate rules that have overlapping functionality or content. This task involves analyzing all cursor rules to discover redundancies, similar patterns, or rules that could be combined to create a more efficient and maintainable rule system. After identifying candidates for consolidation, carefully merge their content while preserving all functionality and ensuring no loss of important guidance.

The consolidation process should result in a leaner, more focused set of rules that provide clear guidance without duplicating information across multiple files. This will reduce maintenance overhead and improve the overall coherence of the rules system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive analysis of all rules to identify overlapping content
- Documentation of consolidation candidates with rationale
- Merged rules that preserve all functionality from source rules
- Updated cross-references throughout the rule system
- New combined rules that follow the standard template
- No loss of functionality or guidance during consolidation
- Clear migration notes for any rules that have been deprecated
- Rule index updated to reflect the consolidated structure
- Version numbers incremented appropriately for modified rules
- Validation tests to ensure functionality is preserved

## Dependencies

- Phase 2 completion (standardized rule format)
- Update existing rules to match template (Task ID: 2025-05-03-06)

## Notes

- Focus on rules with similar purposes or overlapping guidance first
- Consider creating visualization of rule relationships to identify consolidation opportunities
- Maintain a mapping document that shows which original rules contributed to each consolidated rule
- Approach consolidation carefully to avoid losing important nuances
- Look for rules that frequently appear together in conversations
- Consider user feedback on rule confusion or redundancy
- Document the decision criteria used for consolidation
