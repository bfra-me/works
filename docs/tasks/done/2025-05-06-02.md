# Task: Analyze Target Rule File

## Task ID: 2025-05-06-02

## Related Plan

[Vibe-Tools Integration Plan](/docs/plans/vibe-tools-integration-plan.md)

## Description

Analyze the current structure and content of the target rule file, `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc`. Identify the specific sections corresponding to feature definition, planning, task generation, execution, and completion to determine where `vibe-tools` integration points should be added.

## Problem Analysis

- We need to understand the existing structure of the `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule before modifying it
- Integration points for `vibe-tools` must be identified to ensure seamless incorporation
- Workflow stages need to be mapped to specific sections in the rule document
- Existing flow and guidance must be preserved while adding `vibe-tools` functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- Identify the specific sections within [`ai-agile-workflow.mdc`](/.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc) corresponding to feature definition, planning, task generation, execution, and completion
- Understand the current flow and structure of the rule's guidance
- Map sections where `vibe-tools` integration points should be added
- Document any potential conflicts or challenges in integrating new content

Unassigned

## Notes

This task requires careful analysis of the existing rule structure to ensure that `vibe-tools` integration enhances rather than disrupts the current workflow guidance.

## Dependencies

None - This task can be performed in parallel with Task ID 2025-05-06-01.

## Analysis Findings

This analysis maps the structure of `.cursor/rules/ai-agile-workflow.mdc` to standard agile workflow stages, identifies the current flow, and proposes integration points for `vibe-tools`.

### 1. Rule Structure and Workflow Stage Mapping

| Workflow Stage | Corresponding Rule Section(s) in `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` (within `<message>`) | Current Guidance Summary |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Feature Capture | `### Step 1: Capture Features` | Describes using `docs/features.md` |
| Plan Creation | `### Step 2: Create Plan Documents` | Describes AI prompt to generate plan |
| Task Generation | `### Step 3: Generate Task Documents` | Describes AI prompt; mentions checking date/sequence |
| Task Execution | `### Step 4: Execute Tasks` | Focuses on status updates, task notes |
| Status Updates | `### Step 5: Update Task Status`, `### Step 6: Track Progress` | Describes moving files, AI prompts for updates |
| Memory Integration | `### Memory File Update Best Practices` | Details how to update memory files (manual focus) |
|  | `### Updating Workflow Status Memory File` | More specific guidance on updating `workflow-status.md` |
| _New Section Needed_ | N/A | _(Placeholder for Memory Automation section)_ |

### 2. Current Guidance Flow in `ai-agile-workflow.mdc`

The rule currently guides users through a largely manual or AI-prompt-driven process for agile workflow management:

1.  **Feature Capture**: Manually adding features to `docs/features.md`.
2.  **Plan Creation**: Using a generic AI prompt (`Create a plan document for implementing [feature title]`) to generate plan documents.
3.  **Task Generation**: Using a generic AI prompt (`Generate task documents from this plan`) to create task files, with a manual check for date sequencing.
4.  **Task Execution**: Manually updating task status and keeping notes within task files.
5.  **Status Update & Tracking**: Manually moving completed task files to `docs/tasks/done/` and using AI prompts (`Generate progress report for [feature title or ID]`) for feature status updates.
6.  **Memory File Updates**: Provides detailed guidelines for manually updating memory files, especially `workflow-status.md`, emphasizing correct section merging and timestamp management.

### 3. Proposed `vibe-tools` Integration Points within `ai-agile-workflow.mdc`

- **Feature Capture (Enhance `### Step 1`):**
  - **Suggestion**: Before capturing the feature, use `vibe-tools web` for initial research, market analysis, or best practice investigation.
  - **Example**: `vibe-tools web "Research current best practices for [feature area]"`
- **Plan Creation (Enhance `### Step 2`):**
  - **Suggestion**: Recommend `vibe-tools plan "[feature description]"` as a primary method. Highlight its ability to use repository context for more relevant plans.
  - **Example**: `vibe-tools plan "Create a detailed implementation plan for [feature title] considering existing architecture for [related components]" [--with-doc=<relevant_spec_url>]`
- **Task Generation (Enhance `### Step 3`):**
  - **Suggestion**: Recommend `vibe-tools plan "Break down plan: [plan name/link] into tasks"` or `vibe-tools repo "Break down feature [X] into tasks based on [specific files/modules]"`.
  - **Example**: `vibe-tools plan "Generate tasks for Phase 1 of [Plan Title] from docs/plans/[plan-name].md" --save-to=docs/tasks/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-XX.md`. Retain the manual date/sequence check note.
- **Task Execution (Enhance `### Step 4`):**
  - **Suggestion**: Add guidance on using `vibe-tools repo "Explain [module/function]"` for codebase understanding before starting. Suggest `vibe-tools web "How to fix [error/issue]"` or `vibe-tools browser act "Test [action] on [URL]" --url=current` for research/debugging.
  - **Example**: `vibe-tools repo "Show me all usages of the createPlan function in the project."`
- **Status Updates/Tracking (Enhance `### Step 5` & `### Step 6`):**
  - **Suggestion**: Suggest using `vibe-tools repo "Summarize recent commits related to [task ID/feature]"` to help gather information for manual status updates or before generating progress reports with AI prompts.
  - **Example**: `vibe-tools repo "List all files modified in the last 2 days related to 'Vibe-Tools Integration'"`
- **New Section: "Memory File Automation with Vibe-Tools"**:
  - **Placement**: After the existing `### Updating Workflow Status Memory File` section, or as a major subsection under a new broader "Advanced Automation" or "Tool-Assisted Workflow Management" heading.
  - **Content**: This section will host the script examples and explanations for automating memory file updates (extracted in Task `2025-05-06-01`).

### 4. Potential Conflicts or Structural Changes

- **Clarity of Guidance**: The primary challenge is to integrate `vibe-tools` options without making the existing (often simpler AI prompt-based) guidance confusing. It's important to present `vibe-tools` as an enhancement or a more powerful alternative for specific scenarios rather than a complete replacement for every AI interaction.
- **AI Prompts vs. `vibe-tools`**: When suggesting `vibe-tools plan` for plan/task generation, the benefits (repository context, structured output for files) over generic AI prompts should be clearly articulated.
- **Placement of Automation Section**: The new "Memory File Automation" section needs careful placement. It should be distinct from the manual memory update best practices, which are crucial for users to understand first. Presenting it as an advanced/optional enhancement might be best.
- **Cross-Referencing**: Ensure all `vibe-tools` mentions are linked to `vibe-tools.mdc`. The new automation section should also link to `memory-management.mdc`.

### 5. Overall Understanding & Confidence

The `ai-agile-workflow.mdc` rule has a well-defined step-by-step structure for its workflow guidance. This makes it relatively straightforward to identify insertion points for `vibe-tools` commands and examples. The existing sections on document types and memory file handling are comprehensive. The main consideration will be ensuring that the new `vibe-tools` guidance complements and enhances, rather than complicates, the existing instructions for the user.
