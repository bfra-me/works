# Task: Add conflict resolution guidance

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-10

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Develop clear guidance for identifying and resolving conflicts between Cursor rules. This task involves analyzing potential conflict scenarios, documenting resolution strategies, and creating guidelines for prioritizing rule application. The guidance should help AI assistants and developers understand how rules interact, which rules take precedence in different contexts, and how to resolve situations where multiple rules apply to the same context.

This conflict resolution guidance will improve the predictability and consistency of rule application, reduce confusion when multiple rules are triggered, and provide a clear framework for making decisions when rules appear to contradict each other.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive conflict identification guide that:
  - Defines what constitutes a rule conflict
  - Provides methods for detecting potential conflicts
  - Categorizes different types of conflicts
  - Includes examples of common conflict scenarios

- Detailed resolution strategies that:
  - Outline clear steps for resolving each conflict type
  - Provide decision-making frameworks
  - Explain the rationale behind resolution approaches
  - Include precedence rules for different rule categories

- Example conflict scenarios with:
  - Description of the conflict
  - Analysis of rule interactions
  - Step-by-step resolution process
  - Expected outcome after resolution

- Simple guidance documentation:
  - Clear explanatory text
  - Basic diagrams where needed
  - Prioritization guidelines
  - Rule combination recommendations

## Notes

- Focus on establishing clear principles rather than exhaustive rules
- Consider the different types of rules (auto-attached, agent-requested, etc.) and their interaction
- Document how rule priority affects conflict resolution
- Include guidance for developers creating new rules to avoid conflicts
- Consider creating a simple conflict resolution rule that can be activated when conflicts are detected
- Document how contextual factors influence conflict resolution
- Include examples from real-world situations where conflicts occurred
- Remember that Cursor rules are contextual documents for AI assistants, not software components
- Keep documentation simple and focused on practical guidance
