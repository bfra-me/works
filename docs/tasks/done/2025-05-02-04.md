# Task: Create Dependency Management Rule

## Task ID: 2025-05-02-04

## Related Plan

[Develop Rules for Missing Critical Workflows](../plans/develop-missing-workflow-rules.md)

## Description

Develop a comprehensive Cursor rule for dependency management practices within the monorepo. This rule will provide guidance on adding new dependencies, managing workspace dependencies, interacting with Renovate bot, version pinning strategies, and dependency security practices.

This task is part of Phase 2: Core Workflow Rule Development from the "Develop Rules for Missing Critical Workflows" plan and addresses a critical gap in our current guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Development of "dependency-management.mdc" covering:
  - Adding new dependencies
  - Managing workspace dependencies
  - Renovate bot interaction
  - Version pinning strategies
  - Dependency security practices
- Step-by-step guides for common scenarios
- Decision trees for dependency choices
- Proper frontmatter configuration with appropriate globs

- Cross-references to related rules
- Complete metadata section with version, priority, and tags

## Dependencies

- Completion of Phase 1: Gap Analysis and Prioritization tasks from the Missing Critical Workflows plan

## Complexity

## Status

Completed

## Completion Date

## Outcome

The dependency management rule (dependency-management.mdc) was created, providing:

- Step-by-step guides for adding, updating, and managing dependencies in the pnpm monorepo
- Renovate bot usage and version pinning strategies
- Security practices and handling conflicts
- Decision tree for adding dependencies
- Example scenarios and command usage
- Cross-references to related rules
- Complete metadata section

## Assignee

Unassigned

## Notes

- This rule should align with the pnpm workspace structure of the monorepo
- Should include specific examples for adding dependencies to:
  - Root workspace
  - Individual packages
  - Development dependencies vs. runtime dependencies
- Include guidance on managing dependency conflicts
- Address security scanning and vulnerability management
- Reference any existing dependency management scripts or tools used in the repository
