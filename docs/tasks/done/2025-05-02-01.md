## Related Plan

[Develop Rules for Missing Critical Workflows](../../plans/develop-missing-workflow-rules.md)

## Description

Create a comprehensive Cursor rule for testing best practices in the monorepo. This rule will provide guidance on Vitest setup and configuration, test organization patterns, mocking strategies, coverage requirements, and test-driven development workflow.

This task is part of Phase 2: Core Workflow Rule Development from the "Develop Rules for Missing Critical Workflows" plan and addresses a critical gap in our current guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Creation of "testing-practices.mdc" covering:
  - Vitest setup and configuration
  - Test organization patterns
  - Mocking strategies for the monorepo
  - Coverage requirements and reporting
  - Test-driven development workflow
- Comprehensive examples for each testing scenario
- Integration with existing development workflow
- Proper frontmatter configuration following best practices:
  ```
