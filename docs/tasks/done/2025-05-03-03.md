[Develop Rules for Missing Critical Cursor Rules](../plans/develop-missing-cursor-rules.md)

## Description

Create a dedicated Cursor rule file that establishes clear standards and best practices for the code review process. This rule will provide guidance on code review etiquette, required review criteria, PR template usage, handling feedback, and conducting effective self-reviews.

## Problem Analysis

- Code review practices are inconsistent across teams
- Reviewers lack clear criteria for what to look for
- PR templates are not consistently utilized
- Feedback sometimes lacks clarity or actionability
- Self-review practices vary in thoroughness

## Acceptance Criteria

- Creation of "code-review-standards.mdc" for:
  - Code review process and etiquette
  - Required review criteria
  - PR template usage
  - Handling review feedback
  - Self-review checklist
- Examples of effective review comments
- Review workflow diagrams
- Proper frontmatter configuration
- Cross-references to related rules

## Complexity

Medium

## Estimated Effort

1.5 days

## Solution Design
