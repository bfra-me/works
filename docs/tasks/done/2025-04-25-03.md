# Task: Update Cursor Rule Links to Use Proper mdc: Syntax

## Task ID: 2025-04-25-03

## Related Plan

[Implement a Hierarchical Rule Structure with Cross-References](../plans/cursor-rules-hierarchy.md)

## Description

Update all file links in Cursor rule (.mdc) files to use the proper `mdc:` linking syntax instead of custom or inconsistent formats. This includes links to other rule files as well as any other file in the repository. This will ensure all rule files use a standardized linking method that works correctly with the Cursor IDE's rendering and navigation features.

## Problem Analysis

- Current file links in Cursor rules use inconsistent formats like `{rule:rule-name}`, plain text mentions, or vanilla Markdown links
- The correct syntax for any file link from within a Cursor rule is `[display text](mdc:path/to/file.ext)`
- Using incorrect formats prevents proper navigation between files
- For rule references specifically, the format is `[rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc)`
- Inconsistent formats make automated validation difficult
- The lack of standardization reduces the effectiveness of the rules system

## Acceptance Criteria

- All Cursor rule files (.mdc) in the `.cursor/rules/` directory are scanned for file links
- All instances of `{rule:rule-name}` format are replaced with `[rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc)`
- All instances of `@rule-name` format are replaced with `[rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc)`
- All vanilla Markdown links `[text](path)` are replaced with `[text](mdc:path)`
- Any other custom reference formats are also standardized
- "Related Rules" sections use the standard format:
  ```markdown
  ## Related Rules

  - [rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc) - Description of relation
  ```
- Links to other repository files use the format:
  ```markdown
  [filename](mdc:path/to/filename.ext)
  ```
- All links are verified to work correctly in the Cursor IDE
- Rules mentioning file links provide correct examples of the `mdc:` syntax

## Complexity

Medium

## Estimated Effort

2 days

## Solution Design

1. Approach 1: Manual Update
   - Description: Manually search and replace links in each file
   - Pros: High accuracy, ability to add contextual descriptions, careful review of each instance
   - Cons: Time-consuming, potential for human error or missed references
   - Technical considerations: Requires knowledge of all rule files and their relationships

2. Approach 2: Semi-automated Update
   - Description: Use grep to find links, then create a script to replace them
   - Pros: Faster, more consistent, can catch all instances
   - Cons: May require manual review for complex cases, potential for incorrect replacements
   - Technical considerations: Requires creating reliable regex patterns to catch all variations

## Implementation

- [x] Inventory all Cursor rule files
  - [x] Find all .mdc files in the .cursor/rules directory
  - [x] Categorize files based on their content and relationships
  - Success criteria: Complete inventory with mapping of file relationships
  - Dependencies: Access to repository

- [x] Identify links to update
  - [x] Search for `{rule:...}` patterns
  - [x] Search for `@rule-name` references
  - [x] Search for standard Markdown links `[text](path)`
  - [x] Look for "Related Rules" sections that need updating
  - [x] Search for text mentions that should be proper links
  - Success criteria: Comprehensive list of all instances that need updating
  - Dependencies: Completed inventory

- [x] Update link formatting
  - [x] Replace rule references with `[rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc)` format
  - [x] Replace regular file links with `[text](mdc:path)` format
  - [x] Ensure descriptive text is included in brackets
  - [x] Add descriptions for references in "Related Rules" sections
  - [x] Verify all paths are correct
  - Success criteria: All links updated to use proper syntax
  - Dependencies: Identified links to update

- [x] Test in Cursor IDE
  - [x] Verify that links display correctly in the Cursor IDE
  - [x] Test navigation between rules and other files using the links
  - [x] Check that related rules sections are properly formatted
  - Success criteria: All links work correctly in the Cursor IDE
  - Dependencies: Updated links

- [x] Update examples in relevant rules
  - [x] Update any rules that mention linking to use correct examples
  - [x] Ensure the cursor-rule-cross-references rule shows proper syntax for all link types
  - [x] Update any tutorials or documentation
  - Success criteria: All documentation and examples show correct syntax
  - Dependencies: Tested links

## Assignee

Unassigned

## Notes

- This task complements the "Define Standard Linking Format" task (2025-04-25-02)
- The cursor-rule-cross-references rule provides the reference for proper syntax
- The `mdc:` syntax is required for ALL file links from within a Cursor rule file
- All Cursor rule developers should be informed of the correct syntax going forward
- This task is critical for the effectiveness of the hierarchical rule structure

## Dependencies

- Related to "Define Standard Linking Format" task (2025-04-25-02)
- Requires the cursor-rule-cross-references rule to be in place
- Affects all rules that contain links to any files

## Status

### 2025-05-16

Completed

- What's working: All cursor rule files consistently use the proper mdc: syntax for links. Related Rules sections follow the standard format. No instances of old formats like `{rule:rule-name}` or `@rule-name` are being used.
- What's not: N/A
- Blocking issues: None
- Next actions: None
- Documentation updates completed:
  - [x] All rules now use proper mdc: syntax for links
  - [x] Related Rules sections follow standard format
  - [x] Examples in rules show correct syntax
