# Task: Improve rule specificity

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-08

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Enhance the specificity and accuracy of rule activation conditions by refining regex patterns, improving filter configurations, and optimizing rule triggers. This task focuses on ensuring rules are activated in the right contexts with minimal false positives or false negatives. It involves analyzing current rule activation patterns, identifying issues with over-triggering or under-triggering, and implementing more precise activation conditions.

Improving rule specificity will lead to more targeted and relevant AI assistance, reducing noise and increasing the value of the rules system. Rules should activate when they are truly needed and remain silent when they aren't relevant to the current context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Refined regex patterns that accurately capture relevant contexts
- Reduced false positives in rule activation
- Reduced false negatives for important rule activations
- Better examples of triggering and non-triggering contexts
- Clear documentation of rule activation patterns
- Improved message, file_path, and content filter configurations
- Rule trigger conditions that minimize overlap between rules
- Appropriate use of glob patterns for file-specific rules
- Updated rule descriptions that clearly communicate their purpose and activation contexts

## Dependencies

- None (can be worked on independently of other tasks)

## Notes

- Focus on high-priority rules first
- Consider using more advanced regex features for precision
- Document pattern matches with examples of what should and shouldn't match
- Consult with users to understand their expectations for rule activation
- Consider the balance between specificity and recall
- Look for patterns where multiple rules are triggered simultaneously
- Use negative lookahead/lookbehind for more precise regex conditions
- Remember that rules are contextual documents for AI assistants, not code requiring testing
