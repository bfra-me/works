# Task: Perform Workflow Gap Analysis

## Task ID: 2025-05-02-06

## Related Plan

[Develop Rules for Missing Critical Workflows](../plans/develop-missing-workflow-rules.md)

## Description

Analyze the current workflow coverage in the repository to identify gaps where critical development practices are not yet covered by Cursor rules. Inventory all existing rules, compare them against the list of critical workflows (testing, CI/CD, dependency management, API design, debugging, code review), and document which areas lack dedicated rules. Prioritize the missing rules based on workflow importance and pain points. Document findings in a gap analysis report.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive inventory of existing workflow coverage
- Identification of critical gaps in guidance
- Documentation of pain points and common issues
- Analysis of support ticket/question frequency (if available)
- Prioritized list of needed workflow rules
- Gap analysis report created in docs/memory/
