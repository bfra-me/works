# Task: Create basic helper scripts

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-09

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Create simple scripts to assist with common Cursor rule management tasks. These basic helpers will streamline routine activities like creating rule files with proper frontmatter, checking for common formatting issues, and helping maintain the rule index. Unlike complex software tools, these will be straightforward scripts focused on document management tasks.

The focus is on lightweight assistance for rule creators and maintainers, not on building a complex application. These scripts should make it easier to follow best practices when working with Cursor rules as contextual documents.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Simple rule creation script that:
  - Generates a basic rule template with proper frontmatter
  - Prompts for essential information (name, description)
  - Creates files in the correct location

- Basic rule check script that:
  - Identifies common formatting issues
  - Verifies frontmatter structure
  - Checks for required sections

- Rule index helper that:
  - Identifies new rules not in the index
  - Suggests appropriate categorization
  - Provides text to copy into the index

- Documentation of scripts with:
  - Clear usage instructions
  - Examples of common use cases
  - Installation guidance

## Dependencies

- Phase 2 completion (standardized rule format)
- Create rule format template (Task ID: 2025-05-03-05)

## Notes

- Keep scripts simple and focused on document management
- Don't overcomplicate - these are helpers, not applications
- Shell scripts or simple TypeScript should be sufficient
- Focus on the most common and repetitive tasks
- Remember that Cursor rules are contextual documents, not code
- Scripts should emphasize proper rule formatting and organization
- Consider creating simple templates for different rule types
