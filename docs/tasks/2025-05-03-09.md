# Task: Create basic helper scripts

## Task ID: 2025-05-03-09

## Related Plan

[Cursor Rules System Improvements](../plans/cursor-rules-improvement.md)

## Description

Create helper scripts to assist with common Cursor rule management tasks. These basic helpers will streamline routine activities like creating rule files with proper frontmatter, checking for common formatting issues, and helping maintain the rule index.

The scripts will be implemented in TypeScript for better maintainability, type safety, and consistency with the monorepo structure. Unlike complex software tools, these will be straightforward scripts focused on document management tasks.

The focus is on lightweight assistance for rule creators and maintainers, not on building a complex application. These scripts should make it easier to follow best practices when working with Cursor rules as contextual documents.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Rule creation script implemented in TypeScript that:

  - Generates a basic rule template with proper frontmatter
  - Prompts for essential information (name, description)
  - Creates files in the correct location

- Rule check script implemented in TypeScript that:

  - Identifies common formatting issues
  - Verifies frontmatter structure
  - Checks for required sections

- Rule index helper implemented in TypeScript that:

  - Identifies new rules not in the index
  - Suggests appropriate categorization
  - Provides text to copy into the index

- Comprehensive tests for all scripts that:

  - Verify correct functionality
  - Test edge cases and error handling
  - Maintain high code coverage

- Documentation of scripts with:
  - Clear usage instructions
  - Examples of common use cases
  - Installation guidance

## Implementation Steps

- ❌ Convert create-cursor-rule.sh to TypeScript (src/create-cursor-rule.ts)

  - ❌ Implement frontmatter generation
  - ❌ Add prompt for name and description
  - ❌ Implement file creation in correct location
  - ❌ Write comprehensive tests

- ❌ Convert check-rule-metadata.sh to TypeScript (src/check-rule-metadata.ts)

  - ❌ Implement metadata section verification
  - ❌ Add checks for other required sections
  - ❌ Expand to check for all common formatting issues
  - ❌ Write comprehensive tests

- ❌ Create rule index helper script (src/update-rule-index.ts)

  - ❌ Implement rule detection functionality
  - ❌ Add categorization suggestion logic
  - ❌ Implement text generation for index entries
  - ❌ Write comprehensive tests

- ❌ Create comprehensive documentation
  - ❌ Document usage instructions
  - ❌ Provide examples for common use cases
  - ❌ Add installation guidance

## Notes

- Scripts will be written in TypeScript following the monorepo's TypeScript patterns
- All scripts will have comprehensive tests
- Scripts should provide helpful error messages and progress indicators
- Keep scripts simple and focused on document management
- Don't overcomplicate - these are helpers, not applications
- Focus on the most common and repetitive tasks
- Remember that Cursor rules are contextual documents, not code
- Scripts should emphasize proper rule formatting and organization
- Consider creating simple templates for different rule types

## History

- **2025-05-16**: Task requirements updated to implement all scripts in TypeScript rather than shell scripts. This includes converting the existing shell scripts (create-cursor-rule.sh and check-rule-metadata.sh) to TypeScript and implementing the missing rule index helper script in TypeScript. Added requirements for comprehensive tests for all scripts.

- **2025-05-16**: Verified task implementation status. Found partial implementation with two scripts created (create-cursor-rule.sh and check-rule-metadata.sh) but missing the rule index helper script and comprehensive documentation. Updated task status to "In Progress" and added detailed implementation steps with completion status for each component.
