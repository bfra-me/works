# Task: Update Documentation and Rules to Reference Vibe-Tools Playbook

## Task ID: 2025-05-07-02

## Related Plan
[docs/plans/vibe-tools-playbook-integration.md](../plans/vibe-tools-playbook-integration.md)

## Description
Update all relevant documentation, rules, and memory files to reference the newly integrated Vibe-Tools Playbook. Ensure the playbook is discoverable and standardized according to memory-management guidelines. Incorporate feedback from the integration plan and review.

## Problem Analysis
- The Vibe-Tools Playbook contains valuable information but isn't properly referenced in documentation and rules
- Multiple files need to be updated to ensure the playbook is discoverable and accessible
- Current references to vibe-tools capabilities are scattered across different files and may be inconsistent
- The playbook needs to be recognized as the primary user guide for vibe-tools functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- Documentation files (`README.md`, `decisions.md`, `domain-knowledge.md`) reference the playbook
- Rule files (`.cursor/rules/memory-management.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/vibe-tools.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/00-rule-index.mdc`) reference the playbook using correct link syntax
- The playbook is designated as the primary user guide in `vibe-tools.mdc`
- All references use the correct link syntax (`[vibe-tools-playbook](mdc:docs/memory/vibe-tools-playbook.md)`)
- Documentation and rule updates are committed and pushed to the repository

## Complexity
Medium

## Estimated Effort
3 hours

## Solution Design
1. Comprehensive reference update:
   - Systematically update all relevant files with proper references
   - Use consistent link syntax across all files
   - Ensure bidirectional links (files reference playbook and playbook references files)

   Pros: Complete coverage, consistent references
   Cons: Touches multiple files, requires careful coordination

2. Content alignment approach:
   - Review content in both the playbook and referencing files
   - Ensure consistency in terminology and capabilities described
   - Avoid duplicating detailed information that should be maintained in a single location

   Pros: Reduces maintenance burden, single source of truth
   Cons: May require substantial content review and updates

## Implementation
- [ ] Update `docs/memory/README.md`, `decisions.md`, and `domain-knowledge.md` to reference the playbook
  - Success criteria: Files contain proper references to the playbook
  - Dependencies: Task 2025-05-07-01 (playbook migration)

- [ ] Update `.cursor/rules/memory-management.mdc` to reference the playbook
  - Success criteria: Rule includes proper references with the correct link syntax
  - Dependencies: Task 2025-05-07-01 (playbook migration)

- [ ] Update `.cursor/rules/vibe-tools.mdc` to reference the playbook as the primary user guide
  - Success criteria: Rule designates the playbook as the primary source of documentation
  - Dependencies: Task 2025-05-07-01 (playbook migration)

- [ ] Update `.cursor/rules/00-rule-index.mdc` to reference the playbook
  - Success criteria: Rule index includes a reference to the playbook
  - Dependencies: Task 2025-05-07-01 (playbook migration)
