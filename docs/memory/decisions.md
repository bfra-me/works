# Decision Log Memory

This file tracks key technical decisions made during the development of the project, documenting the reasoning, alternatives considered, and implications for future development.

## Architectural Decisions

| Decision ID | Decision | Rationale | Date | Status | Alternatives Considered | Implications |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| ARCH-001 | Adopt monorepo structure | Enables code sharing, coordinated releases | 2025-04-20 | Approved | Multiple repositories | All packages stored in packages/ directory |
| ARCH-002 | Store all cursor rules in .cursor/rules | Ensures consistent location, easy discovery | 2025-04-23 | Approved | Distributed across packages | All rules must be in .cursor/rules with .mdc extension |
| ARCH-003 | Create memory files in docs/memory | Maintains context across conversations | 2025-04-24 | Approved | Per-package memory, no explicit memory | All context must be in docs/memory with .md extension |
| ARCH-004 | Use mdc: prefix only in .mdc rule files | Ensures proper link handling in Cursor rules | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Using prefix everywhere, using standard links everywhere | Links in .mdc files must use mdc: prefix, links in .md files must use standard markdown links |
| ARCH-005 | Implement hierarchical rule structure | Creates coherent rule system | 2025-04-26 | Approved | Flat structure, no relationships | Index must categorize |
| ARCH-006 | Create a single comprehensive showcase file (`vibe-tools-showcase.md`) for all `vibe-tools` examples. | Chosen for ease of maintenance with all examples in one place. Potential lengthiness is mitigated by clear internal organization (by command type and use case). Task ID: 2025-05-07-03.                                                                                                           | 2025-05-20 | Approved | Creating multiple showcase files, one for each `vibe-tools` command type. | Results in a single, potentially large, reference document. Requires good internal navigation (e.g., table of contents, clear headings) for usability.                                                       |
| ARCH-007 | Formalize an existing collection of `vibe-tools` examples rather than creating a new showcase file from scratch. | During task 2025-05-07-03, it was discovered that `docs/memory/vibe-tools-showcase.md` already contained extensive examples. The decision was to leverage this existing work and focus on ensuring it met memory file standards (e.g., adding the `## Updated: YYYY-MM-DD` timestamp). | 2025-05-20 | Approved | Recreating or significantly restructuring all existing examples.        | Saved significant effort by building upon existing content. Ensures valuable prior work is integrated into the standardized memory system. The primary change was standardization rather than content creation. |

## Implementation Decisions

| Decision ID | Decision | Rationale | Date | Status | Alternatives Considered | Implications |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| IMPL-001 | Store memory files in docs/memory | Clear organization, separation of concerns | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Root directory, .cursor directory | All memory file references must use this path |
| IMPL-002 | Use Mermaid for diagrams | Markdown compatible, version control friendly | 2025-04-25 | Approved | PNG/SVG images, external tools | Developers must learn Mermaid syntax |
| IMPL-003 | Task IDs based on date (YYYY-MM-DD-XX) | Clear chronology, unique identifiers | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Sequential numbers, semantic IDs | All task references must use this format |
| IMPL-004 | Explicit .mdc extension in rule references | Clarity, consistency, proper navigation | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Implicit extension, no extension | All rule references must include the .mdc extension |

## Process Decisions

| Decision ID | Decision | Rationale | Date | Status | Alternatives Considered | Implications |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| PROC-001 | Break features into plans, phases, and tasks | Manageable units of work, clear tracking | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Direct feature implementation, informal tasks | More documentation overhead, clearer progress tracking |
| PROC-002 | Use task templates with structured sections | Consistency, comprehensive task definition | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Free-form tasks, minimal structure | All tasks must follow the template format |
| PROC-003 | Update workflow status after significant changes | Maintain context across conversations | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Ad-hoc updates, no formal tracking | Regular updates to workflow-status.md required |
| PROC-004 | Use file-only memory management | Simplified architecture, reduced dependencies | 2025-05-23 | Approved | Knowledge Graph integration, hybrid approach | Memory management relies solely on structured markdown files in docs/memory/ |
| PROC-005 | Integrate vibe-tools into ai-agile-workflow | Enhanced research, planning, context awareness, and automation | 2025-05-06 | Approved | Separate vibe-tools workflow rule, ad-hoc usage without rule integration | All workflow stages enhanced with specific vibe-tools commands, memory file updates can be automated |

## Tool Decisions

| Decision ID | Decision | Rationale | Date | Status | Alternatives Considered | Implications |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| TOOL-001 | Use pnpm for package management | Performance, disk efficiency, workspace support | 2025-04-25 | Approved | npm, yarn | All package operations must use pnpm |
| TOOL-002 | Implement Changesets for versioning | Structured release notes, automated versioning | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Manual versioning, semantic-release | All changes require changeset files |
| TOOL-003 | ESLint with custom config for code quality | Consistent code style, error prevention | 2025-04-25 | Approved | TSLint, no linter | All code must pass ESLint checks |
| TOOL-004 | Cursor AI for development assistance | Enhanced productivity, context-aware help | 2025-04-25 | Approved | GitHub Copilot, no AI assistance | Rules must be maintained for optimal AI behavior |
| TOOL-005 | Use vibe-tools for AI command-line integration | Context-aware AI assistance with repository, planning, and web capabilities | 2025-05-06 | Approved | Custom scripting, direct API calls to AI providers, manual research and planning | Must maintain API keys for providers, outputs should be reviewed before incorporating into memory files |
| TOOL-006 | Designate [vibe-tools-playbook](/docs/memory/vibe-tools-playbook.md) as primary vibe-tools documentation | Comprehensive, structured guide for all vibe-tools commands and usage scenarios | 2025-05-16 | Approved | Relying only on vibe-tools.mdc rule, scattering documentation across files | vibe-tools.mdc remains concise reference for AI assistants, playbook serves as complete user guide; all documentation and rules should reference the playbook |

## Open Decisions

| Decision ID | Topic | Options | Considerations | Target Date |
