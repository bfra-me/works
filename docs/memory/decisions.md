# Decision Log Memory

This file tracks key technical decisions made during the development of the project, documenting the reasoning, alternatives considered, and implications for future development.

## Architectural Decisions

| Decision ID | Decision | Rationale | Date | Status | Alternatives Considered | Implications |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| ARCH-001 | Adopt monorepo structure | Enables code sharing, coordinated releases | 2025-04-20 | Approved | Multiple repositories | All packages stored in packages/ directory |
| ARCH-002 | Store all cursor rules in .cursor/rules | Ensures consistent location, easy discovery | 2025-04-23 | Approved | Distributed across packages | All rules must be in .cursor/rules with .mdc extension |
| ARCH-003 | Create memory files in docs/memory | Maintains context across conversations | 2025-04-24 | Approved | Per-package memory, no explicit memory | All context must be in docs/memory with .md extension |
| ARCH-004 | Use mdc: prefix only in .mdc rule files | Ensures proper link handling in Cursor rules | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Using prefix everywhere, using standard links everywhere | Links in .mdc files must use mdc: prefix, links in .md files must use standard markdown links |
| ARCH-005 | Implement hierarchical rule structure | Creates coherent rule system | 2025-04-26 | Approved | Flat structure, no relationships | Rules must reference related rules, index must categorize |

## Implementation Decisions

| Decision ID | Decision | Rationale | Date | Status | Alternatives Considered | Implications |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| IMPL-001 | Store memory files in docs/memory | Clear organization, separation of concerns | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Root directory, .cursor directory | All memory file references must use this path |
| IMPL-002 | Use Mermaid for diagrams | Markdown compatible, version control friendly | 2025-04-25 | Approved | PNG/SVG images, external tools | Developers must learn Mermaid syntax |
| IMPL-003 | Task IDs based on date (YYYY-MM-DD-XX) | Clear chronology, unique identifiers | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Sequential numbers, semantic IDs | All task references must use this format |
| IMPL-004 | Explicit .mdc extension in rule references | Clarity, consistency, proper navigation | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Implicit extension, no extension | All rule references must include the .mdc extension |

## Process Decisions

| Decision ID | Decision | Rationale | Date | Status | Alternatives Considered | Implications |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| PROC-001 | Break features into plans, phases, and tasks | Manageable units of work, clear tracking | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Direct feature implementation, informal tasks | More documentation overhead, clearer progress tracking |
| PROC-002 | Use task templates with structured sections | Consistency, comprehensive task definition | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Free-form tasks, minimal structure | All tasks must follow the template format |
| PROC-003 | Update workflow status after significant changes | Maintain context across conversations | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Ad-hoc updates, no formal tracking | Regular updates to workflow-status.md required |
| PROC-004 | Implement knowledge graph entities for key components | Enhanced relationship tracking | 2025-04-25 | Approved | File-only tracking, no graph | Knowledge graph must be maintained alongside files |

## Tool Decisions

| Decision ID | Decision | Rationale | Date | Status | Alternatives Considered | Implications |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| TOOL-001 | Use pnpm for package management | Performance, disk efficiency, workspace support | 2025-04-25 | Approved | npm, yarn | All package operations must use pnpm |
| TOOL-002 | Implement Changesets for versioning | Structured release notes, automated versioning | 2025-04-25 | Approved | Manual versioning, semantic-release | All changes require changeset files |
| TOOL-003 | ESLint with custom config for code quality | Consistent code style, error prevention | 2025-04-25 | Approved | TSLint, no linter | All code must pass ESLint checks |
| TOOL-004 | Cursor AI for development assistance | Enhanced productivity, context-aware help | 2025-04-25 | Approved | GitHub Copilot, no AI assistance | Rules must be maintained for optimal AI behavior |

## Open Decisions

| Decision ID | Topic | Options | Considerations | Target Date |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| OPEN-001 | Automation for rule cross-references | Script to validate links, automated updates, manual management | Maintenance overhead, accuracy, developer experience | 2025-05-15 |
| OPEN-002 | Rule registry format | JSON, YAML, Markdown table | Machine readability, human editability, integration | 2025-05-01 |
| OPEN-003 | Memory synchronization protocol | One-way (files to graph), bidirectional, event-based | Consistency, performance, complexity | 2025-05-10 |

## Decision-Making Process

1. **Identification**: Issue or improvement opportunity is identified
2. **Analysis**: Options are evaluated against criteria
3. **Recommendation**: Preferred option is selected with rationale
4. **Review**: Decision is reviewed by stakeholders
5. **Decision**: Final decision is recorded with status
6. **Implementation**: Decision is implemented in the codebase
7. **Evaluation**: Effectiveness of decision is evaluated
