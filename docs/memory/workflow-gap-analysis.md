# Workflow Gap Analysis

## Overview
This report documents the current state of workflow coverage in the repository, identifies gaps where critical development practices lack dedicated Cursor rules, and prioritizes the creation of new rules to address these gaps. The analysis is based on the [Develop Rules for Missing Critical Workflows](../plans/develop-missing-workflow-rules.md) plan, user preferences, and recent workflow history.

## Inventory of Existing Workflow-Related Cursor Rules

| Rule Name | Description | Category |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| ai-agile-workflow | Task/plan management, agile workflow, task tracking | Workflow & Process |
| changeset-workflow | Versioning, changelogs, release process | Workflow & Process |
| development-workflow | Dev, test, release, CI/CD overview | Workflow & Process |
| eslint-config-usage | ESLint configuration and usage | Configuration Guide |
| prettier-config-usage | Prettier configuration and usage | Configuration Guide |
| typescript-patterns | TypeScript patterns and best practices | Coding Standards |
| anthropic-chain-of-thought | Prompt engineering, chain-of-thought | Coding Standards |
| date-consistency-enforcer | Date/timestamp consistency | Coding Standards |
| auto-memory-manager | Memory/knowledge graph update automation | AI & Memory Management |
| memory-management | Persistent memory file management | AI & Memory Management |
| user-preferences-awareness | User preference access and application | AI & Memory Management |
| repo-analyzer | Repository analysis and code context extraction | Repository Structure |
| monorepo-structure | Monorepo/package structure guidance | Repository Structure |

## Identification of Critical Workflow Gaps

The following critical workflows are not currently covered by dedicated Cursor rules:

- **Testing Best Practices** (Vitest setup, test organization, coverage, mocking, TDD)
- **CI/CD Troubleshooting and Interaction** (local/CI connection, failure handling, release automation, branch protection)
- **Dependency Management** (adding/updating dependencies, workspace management, Renovate, version pinning, security)
- **API Design Standards** (API patterns, type safety, deprecation/versioning, documentation)
- **Debugging and Troubleshooting** (error patterns, logging, debugging tools, performance, environment issues)
- **Code Review Standards** (review process, PR templates, feedback, self-review)

## Documentation of Pain Points and Common Issues

- **Testing**: Lack of guidance for Vitest, test structure, and coverage reporting. New contributors are unsure how to organize and write effective tests.
- **CI/CD**: Unclear troubleshooting steps for CI failures, branch protection, and release automation. Developers report confusion when CI fails or when releases are blocked.
- **Dependency Management**: No step-by-step guide for adding/updating dependencies, managing workspace dependencies, or handling Renovate bot updates.
- **API Design**: No standards for public API patterns, type safety, or deprecation/versioning policies.
- **Debugging**: No central resource for common error patterns, logging, or debugging tools.
- **Code Review**: No documented review process, criteria, or PR template usage guidance.
- **General**: Previous pain points (e.g., ESLint/TypeScript/Markdown integration) required ad hoc memory files; similar workflow issues are likely to recur without dedicated rules.

## Prioritized List of Needed Workflow Rules

| Priority | Rule Name | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| High | testing-practices.mdc | Most frequent pain point; critical for code quality and onboarding |
| High | ci-cd-workflow.mdc | Essential for smooth development and release; frequent confusion |
| High | dependency-management.mdc | Key for monorepo health and security; no current guidance |
| Medium | api-design-standards.mdc | Important for consistency and maintainability |
| Medium | debugging-guide.mdc | Needed for troubleshooting and reducing support burden |
| Medium | code-review-standards.mdc | Improves code quality and collaboration |

## Next Steps

1. Draft new Cursor rules for the highest priority gaps: testing-practices, ci-cd-workflow, and dependency-management.
2. Use the [cursor-rules-creation](../../.cursor/rules/cursor-rules-creation.mdc) process and reference user preferences for structure and content.
3. Coordinate with subject matter experts for best practices and examples.
4. After drafting, update the rule registry and cross-references.
5. Plan user testing and feedback for new rules.
