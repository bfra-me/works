# Agile Workflow Enhancements with Vibe-Tools

## Overview

This document outlines approaches for enhancing the ai-agile-workflow rule with vibe-tools integration to improve planning, research, repository context gathering, and documentation processes.

## Key Integration Areas

### Planning and Estimation Enhancement

- Use **`vibe-tools plan`** during sprint planning to break down user stories or epics into actionable tasks:
  ```bash
  vibe-tools plan "Break down this user story: As a user, I want to reset my password via email so I can regain access if I forget it. Detail backend, frontend, integration, and testing tasks with skill requirements."
  ```

- Generate accurate estimates with context-aware planning:
  ```bash
  vibe-tools plan "Estimate effort for implementing a TypeScript config package with story points using Fibonacci scale (1,2,3,5,8,13). Identify dependencies and uncertainties."
  ```

- Prototype solutions during planning to uncover hidden complexities:
  ```bash
  vibe-tools plan "Prototype a solution for implementing rule cross-references in Cursor rules. Identify potential challenges and dependencies."
  ```

### Web Research and Discovery

- Use **`vibe-tools web`** for targeted research during backlog refinement:
  ```bash
  vibe-tools web "Research best practices for implementing semantic versioning in a monorepo structure similar to our project. Focus on automation and integration with existing workflows."
  ```

- Gather information on technical approaches during sprint planning:
  ```bash
  vibe-tools web "Compare approaches for implementing cross-references between Markdown files with focus on compatibility with VS Code and Cursor IDE."
  ```

- Resolve blockers during implementation with up-to-date information:
  ```bash
  vibe-tools web "How to resolve circular dependencies in TypeScript packages within a monorepo structure using PNPM workspaces."
  ```

### Repository Context Gathering

- Use **`vibe-tools repo`** for context discovery at task start:
  ```bash
  vibe-tools repo "Identify all files related to the task workflow system in this repository and explain their relationships."
  ```

- Survey existing implementations for similar features:
  ```bash
  vibe-tools repo "Find examples of timestamp handling in memory files and explain the pattern used."
  ```

- Document architectural decisions with repository context:
  ```bash
  vibe-tools repo "Document how rule versioning is currently implemented and provide an overview of the semantic versioning approach."
  ```

### Memory File Automation

- Use vibe-tools to automatically update memory files like workflow-status.md:
  ```bash
  # Get the current sprint status and update the workflow status file
  vibe-tools repo "Summarize the current sprint status, including completed tasks, in-progress tasks, and upcoming tasks" --save-to sprint-summary.txt

  # Use this output to update the memory file
  SPRINT_SUMMARY=$(<sprint-summary.txt)
  vibe-tools ask "Format this sprint summary as a markdown update for the workflow-status.md memory file, following the structure in the memory-management cursor rule" > workflow-status-update.md
  ```

- Generate task breakdowns and save directly to task files:
  ```bash
  # Generate a task breakdown and save directly to a new task file
  vibe-tools plan "Break down this feature: Cross-referencing between Cursor rules" --save-to docs/tasks/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-01.md
  ```

- Update memory files after task completion:
  ```bash
  # After task completion, summarize changes and update the memory file
  vibe-tools repo "Summarize the changes made to implement the cross-reference feature" > feature-summary.txt

  # Use output to update the domain knowledge memory file
  FEATURE_SUMMARY=$(<feature-summary.txt)
  vibe-tools ask "Extract key technical decisions, implementation patterns, and concepts from this feature summary for addition to the domain-knowledge.md memory file\n\nContent to process:\n$FEATURE_SUMMARY" > domain-knowledge-updates.md
  ```

## Enhanced Process Workflow

### 1. Feature Definition with Web Research

Start by researching features using `vibe-tools web` to ensure features align with industry standards and best practices:

```bash
vibe-tools web "What are the current best practices for implementing cross-references in documentation that need to work in both web and IDE environments?"
```

### 2. Plan Generation with AI Planning

Create comprehensive plans that consider repository structure and context:

```bash
vibe-tools plan "Create a detailed implementation plan for adding cross-referencing capabilities to Cursor rules. Include phases, tasks, acceptance criteria and estimated story points."
```

### 3. Task Breakdown with Repository Context

Generate tasks with awareness of the existing codebase:

```bash
vibe-tools repo "Break down the implementation of cross-references into discrete tasks based on the current structure of Cursor rules. Consider file paths, parsing requirements, and rendering approaches."
```

### 4. Task Execution with Repository and Web Support

During implementation, gather context and research solutions:

```bash
# Getting context before starting a task
vibe-tools repo "Show me all places where memory files are read or written to understand the current pattern"

# Researching solutions during implementation
vibe-tools web "What's the most efficient regex pattern for detecting markdown links to specific file types?"
```

### 5. Status Updates and Documentation

Generate comprehensive updates and documentation:

```bash
vibe-tools repo "Summarize the changes I've made to implement cross-references between rule files, with examples of before and after."
```

## Memory File Automation with Vibe-Tools

### Automated Workflow Status Updates

When tasks are completed or status changes, use vibe-tools to generate comprehensive status updates:

```bash
# Create a shell script to automate workflow status updates
# update-workflow-status.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Get current date
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Gather repository status
vibe-tools repo "Analyze recent commits and provide a summary of task progress" > status_summary.txt

# Generate a formatted update for the workflow-status.md file
STATUS_SUMMARY=$(<status_summary.txt)
vibe-tools ask "Format this as a workflow status update for the workflow-status.md file. Follow this structure:\n1. Update the 'Current State' section with new information\n2. Add completed tasks to the 'Task History' table\n3. Update the 'Recent Updates' section with new entries\n4. Ensure the 'Updated: $TODAY' is at the very end\nMake sure to follow the Memory Management rule requirements\n\nContent to format:\n$STATUS_SUMMARY" > workflow_update.md

# Apply the update to workflow-status.md
# This is a simplified example - in practice you would need to merge this content with the existing file
cat workflow_update.md >> docs/memory/workflow-status.md
```

### Daily Standup Automation

Create automatic updates based on recent activity in the repository:

```bash
# standup-memory-update.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Get the current date
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Get recent activity from the repository
vibe-tools repo "Summarize the last 24 hours of development activity, including:
1. What tasks were worked on
2. What was completed
3. Any blockers or issues identified" --save-to daily_activity.txt

# Generate a formatted standup update
DAILY_ACTIVITY=$(<daily_activity.txt)
vibe-tools ask "Format this development activity as a daily standup report for $TODAY.\nInclude sections for:\n1. Completed work\n2. In-progress tasks\n3. Blockers or issues\n4. Plan for today\nFormat as markdown suitable for adding to a memory file.\n\nContent to format:\n$DAILY_ACTIVITY" > standup_update.md

# Add the update to a standup history file
echo -e "\n\n## Standup: $TODAY\n" >> docs/memory/standup-history.md
cat standup_update.md >> docs/memory/standup-history.md
```

### Domain Knowledge Updates

Use vibe-tools to extract domain knowledge from completed work:

```bash
# Update domain knowledge based on completed tasks
# update-domain-knowledge.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Get the current date
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Identify recently completed tasks
vibe-tools repo "Find recently completed tasks in the docs/tasks/done directory" > completed_tasks.txt

# For each completed task, extract knowledge
cat completed_tasks.txt | xargs -I{} vibe-tools repo "Extract domain knowledge from {} including:
1. New concepts implemented
2. Implementation patterns used
3. Technical decisions made
4. Lessons learned" > domain_extracts.txt

# Format the extracts for the domain knowledge memory file
DOMAIN_EXTRACTS=$(<domain_extracts.txt)
vibe-tools ask "Format this information as updates for the domain-knowledge.md memory file.
Organize the content into these sections:
1. Core Concepts
2. Implementation Patterns
3. Technical Decisions
4. External Resources
Format as markdown and ensure each item is properly categorized.
\nContent to format:
$DOMAIN_EXTRACTS" > domain_updates.md

# Now you would need to merge these updates into the existing file
# This is a simplified example
```

### Sprint Planning Integration

During sprint planning, use vibe-tools to generate comprehensive plan documentation:

```bash
# generate-sprint-plan.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Set sprint variables
SPRINT_NUMBER="2"
SPRINT_GOAL="Implement cross-referencing between Cursor rules"
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Generate sprint plan
vibe-tools plan "Create a sprint plan for Sprint $SPRINT_NUMBER with the goal: $SPRINT_GOAL.
Include:
1. Sprint objectives
2. User stories to be implemented
3. Task breakdown for each story
4. Estimated story points
5. Dependencies and risks" > sprint_plan.txt

# Format the plan as a sprint plan document
SPRINT_PLAN=$(<sprint_plan.txt)
vibe-tools ask "Format this as a comprehensive sprint plan document in markdown format.
Include:
1. Sprint details (number, dates, goal)
2. User stories with acceptance criteria
3. Tasks with estimates
4. Sprint burndown projection
5. Risk assessment
\nContent to format:
$SPRINT_PLAN" > sprint_$SPRINT_NUMBER\_plan.md

# Save to plans directory
cp sprint_$SPRINT_NUMBER\_plan.md docs/plans/sprint_$SPRINT_NUMBER.md
```

### Retrospective Insights

After sprint retrospectives, generate actionable insights and update memory files:

```bash
# process-retrospective.sh

#!/bin/bash

# Set variables
SPRINT_NUMBER="1"
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Collect retrospective notes (assuming they're in a text file)
RETRO_NOTES=$(cat retro_notes.txt)

# Process retrospective with vibe-tools
vibe-tools ask "Extract key insights from these Sprint $SPRINT_NUMBER retrospective notes, organized into:
1. What went well
2. What could be improved
3. Actionable items with owners
Format the response as markdown suitable for a retrospective memory file.
\nContent to process:
$RETRO_NOTES" > retro_insights.md

# Add to retrospectives memory file
echo -e "\n\n## Sprint $SPRINT_NUMBER Retrospective ($TODAY)\n" >> docs/memory/retrospectives.md
cat retro_insights.md >> docs/memory/retrospectives.md

# Generate action items for tracking
RETRO_INSIGHTS=$(<retro_insights.md)
vibe-tools ask "Extract all action items from this retrospective and format them as task entries
following the ai-agile-workflow format. Each task should have:
1. Task title
2. Description
3. Acceptance criteria
4. Assignee
5. Estimated effort
\nContent to process:
$RETRO_INSIGHTS" > action_tasks.md

# Now these could be added to the task tracking system
```
