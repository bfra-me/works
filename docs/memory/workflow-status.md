The Vibe-Tools Integration plan outlines the steps for integrating vibe-tools commands (plan, web, repo, mcp, browser) into the existing feature => plan => task workflow process. The plan includes detailed tasks for updating the rule with relevant command examples and adding guidance on memory file automation. Task documents from 2025-05-06-08 to 2025-05-06-16 have been generated.

The Vibe-Tools Playbook Integration plan focuses on integrating the vibe-tools-playbook.md into the memory file system as a first-class project knowledge file, ensuring it's properly referenced in all relevant documentation and rules, and aligning its content with the vibe-tools.mdc rule.

This status reflects the current state tracked in the project's memory files and is synchronized with the Knowledge Graph (the assistant's persistent memory) for enhanced context retention across sessions. See [memory-management](/.cursor/rules/memory-management.mdc) for details on Knowledge Graph tools, operations, and integration processes.

## Notes

- The Vibe-Tools Integration plan involves 16 specific tasks that will be created and executed in sequence
- Phase 1 (Preparation and Review) tasks are currently being implemented in parallel
- All rules must include a "Related Rules" section with proper `mdc:` links
- Bidirectional relationships should be maintained on both sides for consistency
- The rule index should serve as the central entry point for rule discovery
- The standard format for cross-references is `[rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc)`
- Vibe-tools integration plan will enhance the ai-agile-workflow rule to leverage vibe-tools capabilities at each stage of the workflow
- The memory automation section in ai-agile-workflow.mdc was found to already exist when task 2025-05-06-10 was started, with comprehensive guidance on AI context, script templates, and best practices
- Task 2025-05-06-11 added script examples for daily standup automation, sprint planning integration, and retrospective insights processing to enhance the memory file automation guidance in ai-agile-workflow.mdc
- The Vibe-Tools Playbook Integration plan aims to integrate the vibe-tools-playbook.md as a first-class memory file and ensure it is properly referenced throughout documentation and rules
- Task 2025-05-07-01 is a prerequisite for Task 2025-05-07-02 as the playbook must be properly migrated before updating references to it
- Workflow status entities in the Knowledge Graph need to be updated after each task completion to ensure consistent state tracking across sessions
- Completed Task 2025-05-06-12 (Add Guidance on Automation Integration). Added a section to ai-agile-workflow.mdc explaining when and how automation scripts should be used at various points in the agile workflow. (2025-05-06)
