## Context

The Cursor Rules Enhancement project is focused on improving the organization, structure, and clarity of the Cursor rules system. We have completed Phase 1 (Foundation Work) by creating a comprehensive rule index and implementing version control across all rules. We are now working on Phase 2 (Structural Standardization), with significant progress made on standardizing rule descriptions to follow the "VERB when CONTEXT to OUTCOME" pattern.

We have refined our understanding of Cursor rules to recognize that they are specialized markdown documents (.mdc files) that provide conditional context to AI assistants - not application features requiring traditional development practices like testing or metrics. This refined understanding has led to a streamlined plan that focuses purely on improving the rules as contextual documents for AI assistance.

The revised plan now has 4 phases (down from 5), removing tasks related to testing frameworks, validation tests, analytics, and metrics:
1. Foundation Work (Completed)
2. Structural Standardization
3. Content Optimization
4. Rule Interaction Management

We have now created all task documents for the revised plan, with a total of 11 tasks across all phases:
- Phase 2 (4 tasks): Create rule format template (Completed), Update existing rules to match template, Document rule application types (Completed), Enhance rule creation guidance
- Phase 3 (3 tasks): Consolidate overlapping rules, Improve rule specificity, Enhance rule examples and documentation
- Phase 4 (4 tasks): Create basic helper scripts, Add conflict resolution guidance (Completed), Prioritize rule application (Completed), Document rule interaction patterns

The "Document rule application types" task has been completed, creating comprehensive documentation about the four rule application types (auto-attached, agent requested, always applied, and manual). This includes detailed guidance on when to use each type, configuration examples, best practices, and potential pitfalls. The documentation is available at `docs/memory/rule-application-types.md`.

The "Enhance rule examples and documentation" task (ID: 2025-05-03-13) is also complete, improving the clarity and practical utility of existing rules.

The "Prioritize rule application" task (ID: 2025-05-03-14) is now complete. Guidelines for rule prioritization have been added to `cursor-rules-creation.mdc`.

Phase 4 is now underway, with the documentation of rule interactions completed. The next focus is creating basic helper scripts.

The "Add conflict resolution guidance" task (ID: 2025-05-03-10) is now complete, with a comprehensive guidance document created at `docs/memory/rule-conflict-resolution.md`. This document provides detailed instructions for identifying and resolving conflicts between Cursor rules, including conflict types, resolution strategies, and example scenarios with step-by-step resolution processes.

## Notes

- All task documents for the revised Cursor Rules Improvement plan have now been created
- Work will proceed in phase order, starting with completing Phase 2 tasks
- Cursor rules are specialized markdown documents providing conditional context to AI assistants - NOT application features requiring testing or metrics
- Rules are simply well-formatted documents with frontmatter, content, examples, and metadata
- The revised plan treats rules appropriately as contextual documents rather than software features
- The separate rule-template.mdc file was deemed redundant and has been removed since cursor-rules-creation.mdc already provides comprehensive guidance
- All Cursor rule files (.mdc) MUST be placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory according to the cursor-rules-location rule
- Next focus should be on updating existing rules to ensure consistency
- We've reduced the estimated project timeline from 8 weeks to 6 weeks by removing unnecessary complexity
- Helper scripts should remain simple tools focused on document management, not complex applications
- The Rule Index provides a good foundation but needs to be updated as rules are modified
- Focus on making rules clear, well-structured, and properly activated in the right contexts
- Remember that the sole purpose of rules is to enhance AI conversations by supplying relevant contextual knowledge
- The documentation on rule application types provides a comprehensive guide for selecting and configuring the appropriate rule application type
- Understanding when to use each application type (auto-attached, agent requested, always applied, manual) is critical for effective rule activation
- Focus on making rules clear, well-structured, and properly activated in the right contexts

- The documentation on rule application types provides a comprehensive guide for selecting and configuring the appropriate rule application type
- Understanding when to use each application type (auto-attached, agent requested, always applied, manual) is critical for effective rule activation
- Defining rule prioritization is the next step in managing how rules interact.
- The new `docs/memory/rule-interactions.md` file provides a central place to understand how rules work together.
- The new `docs/memory/rule-conflict-resolution.md` document provides comprehensive guidance for identifying and resolving conflicts between rules.
