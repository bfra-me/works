## Context

The current tasks involve work on two parallel plans:

1.  **Cursor Rules Hierarchy (Task 2025-05-03-05)**: Continuing to update the Cursor rule index and establish comprehensive bidirectional cross-references between all Cursor rule files. Task 2025-05-03-04 (Update Cursor Rule Index and Cross-References) is complete.

2.  **Vibe-Tools Integration**: We've completed Phase 1 (Preparation and Review) and Phase 2 tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4. Phase 2.5 is now the active task.

    Phase 1 (completed):
    *   2025-05-06-01: Review Source Analysis Document
    *   2025-05-06-02: Analyze Target Rule File
    *   2025-05-06-03: Review Formatting & Structure Guidelines
    *   2025-05-06-04: Review Vibe-Tools Rule

    Phase 2 (Content Integration - Workflow Stages - in progress):
    *   Phase 2.1: Integrate `vibe-tools web` for Feature Definition/Research (Task 2025-05-06-05 - completed)
    *   Phase 2.2: Integrate `vibe-tools plan` for Plan Creation (Completed)

    *   Phase 2.4: Integrate `vibe-tools repo` / `web` / `browser` for Task Execution (Task ID: 2025-05-06-08 - completed)
    *   **Current Task: Phase 2.5 - Integrate `vibe-tools repo` for Status Updates/Reviews (Task ID: 2025-05-06-09)**
    *   Next Vibe-Tools Task: Phase 3.1 - Draft Memory Automation Section (Task ID: 2025-05-06-10)

The Vibe-Tools Integration plan outlines the steps for integrating vibe-tools commands (plan, web, repo, mcp, browser) into the existing feature => plan => task workflow process. The plan includes detailed tasks for updating the rule with relevant command examples and adding guidance on memory file automation. Task documents from 2025-05-06-08 to 2025-05-06-16 have been generated.

## Notes

- The Vibe-Tools Integration plan involves 16 specific tasks that will be created and executed in sequence
- Phase 1 (Preparation and Review) tasks are currently being implemented in parallel
- All rules must include a "Related Rules" section with proper `mdc:` links
- Bidirectional relationships should be maintained on both sides for consistency
- The rule index should serve as the central entry point for rule discovery
- The standard format for cross-references is `[rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc)`
- Vibe-tools integration plan will enhance the ai-agile-workflow rule to leverage vibe-tools capabilities at each stage of the workflow
