## Context

The current task (2025-05-03-04) involves updating the Cursor rule index and establishing comprehensive bidirectional cross-references between all Cursor rule files. We have completed the analysis phase, which involved analyzing all 24 cursor rules to identify their relationships with each other, relevant files, and tools/commands. The analysis revealed several key patterns in the rule ecosystem, including foundational rules, workflow chains, tool integrations, standards enforcement, memory/context integration, and bidirectional links.

The next phase is implementation, which will involve adding the identified cross-references to each rule file using the proper `mdc:` syntax, updating the `00-rule-index.mdc` file, creating a visual relationship diagram, and verifying the reference validity. **Progress update: Cross-references and metadata updated for api-design-standards, changeset-workflow, ci-cd-workflow, code-review-standards, cursor-rules-creation, debugging-guide, dependency-management, development-workflow, eslint-config-usage.**

## Notes

- All rules must include a "Related Rules" section with proper `mdc:` links
- Bidirectional relationships should be maintained on both sides for consistency
- The rule index should serve as the central entry point for rule discovery
- The standard format for cross-references is `[rule-name](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc)`
