## Context

The current tasks involve work on two active projects:

1. **Memory Management System**: This project aims to create a comprehensive memory management system using memory files and knowledge graph integration to maintain context across conversations. We're establishing standardized files like workflow-status.md, architecture.md, and user-preferences.md to maintain persistent context.

2. **Vibe-Tools Playbook Integration**: We're integrating the Vibe-Tools Playbook as a first-class memory file. Currently working on Task 2025-05-07-03 (Create Showcase Documents) with the next task being 2025-05-07-04 (Define Standard Operational Guidelines).

The Cursor Rules System Improvement project has been completed, including all tasks related to rule hierarchies, cross-references, standardization, and Vibe-Tools integration in the rules. Features 1, 2, and 4 from the features.md file have been marked as completed, and all related tasks have been finished. The work completed on Cursor Rules has established a well-structured system of rules with clear hierarchies, consistent formatting, and comprehensive cross-references.

The current focus is on:
1. Continuing the integration of the Vibe-Tools Playbook as a first-class memory file
2. Further developing the Memory Management System to improve context retention across sessions

This status reflects the current state tracked in the project's memory files and is synchronized with the Knowledge Graph (the assistant's persistent memory) for enhanced context retention across sessions. See [memory-management](/.cursor/rules/memory-management.mdc) for details on Knowledge Graph tools, operations, and integration processes.
