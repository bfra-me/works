## Context

We are currently working on multiple parallel projects to improve the Cursor rules system:

1. **Hierarchical Rule Structure**: Implementing cross-references between rules to create a navigable knowledge system. Currently creating a relationship diagram of all rules and defining the standard linking format. A new rule for cross-references has been created to define the proper syntax for linking between Cursor rules and to all other files in the repository.

2. **Consolidation of Overlapping Rules**: Planning to reduce the number of rules from 12 to 7-8 more comprehensive units organized by functional purpose. Plan document has been created but implementation has not started.

3. **Missing Workflow Rules**: Planning to create new rules for testing, CI/CD, dependency management, and API design. Plan document has been created but implementation has not started.

4. **Memory Management System**: Creating a comprehensive memory management system with memory files and knowledge graph integration. We've created all key memory files (workflow-status.md, architecture.md, user-preferences.md, domain-knowledge.md, and decisions.md) according to the templates defined in the memory-management rule. These files provide persistent context for AI assistants across conversations.

All plans have been created and are documented in the docs/plans/ directory. Tasks for the first feature (Hierarchical Rule Structure) have been created and are in progress.

## Notes

- AI assistants should update this file after each significant change to maintain context
- The date in task IDs should be generated using `$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`
- Completed tasks should be moved to a `docs/tasks/done/` directory
- Task status should be updated in this file and in the plan document
- When using knowledge graph MCP server, remember to sync memory files with graph entities
- All plan documents follow a consistent structure with phases, tasks, acceptance criteria, and maintenance considerations
- Rule development should follow the best practices identified in the cursor-rules-location rule and the research on Cursor rules
- The cursor-rule-cross-references rule defines the proper syntax for linking in Cursor rules, which is `[display text](mdc:path/to/file.ext)` for ALL file links
- All memory files should follow the templates defined in the memory-management rule
- Memory files now exist for workflow status, architecture, user preferences, domain knowledge, and decisions
