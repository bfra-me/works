## Context

We are currently working on multiple parallel projects to improve the Cursor rules system:

1. **Hierarchical Rule Structure**: Implementing cross-references between rules to create a navigable knowledge system. Currently creating a relationship diagram of all rules and defining the standard linking format. A new rule for cross-references has been created to define the proper syntax for linking between Cursor rules and to all other files in the repository.

2. **Consolidation of Overlapping Rules**: Planning to reduce the number of rules from 12 to 7-8 more comprehensive units organized by functional purpose. Plan document has been created but implementation has not started.

3. **Missing Workflow Rules**: Actively developing new rules for testing, CI/CD, dependency management, and API design. We have completed several tasks related to this feature:
   - Created testing practices rule (Task ID: 2025-05-02-01)
   - Created CI/CD workflow rule (Task ID: 2025-05-02-02)
   - Fixed CI/CD workflow rule frontmatter (Task ID: 2025-05-02-03)
   - Dependency management rule is planned (Task ID: 2025-05-02-04)
   - Workflow gap analysis (Task ID: 2025-05-02-06) is in progress
   This feature has been updated from "Not Started" to "In Progress" based on the completed tasks.

4. **Memory Management System**: Creating a comprehensive memory management system with memory files and knowledge graph integration. We've created all key memory files (workflow-status.md, architecture.md, user-preferences.md, domain-knowledge.md, and decisions.md) according to the templates defined in the memory-management rule. These files provide persistent context for AI assistants across conversations.

5. **ESLint Configuration Improvement**: Fixed issues with TypeScript ESLint integration, particularly focusing on the problem of parsing errors when using type-aware linting with Markdown files containing TypeScript code blocks. The solution involved disabling type-aware rules specifically for Markdown files while maintaining linting for other aspects. Detailed documentation of the issue and solution has been added to [eslint-typescript-markdown-issue.md](/docs/memory/eslint-typescript-markdown-issue.md).

6. **Cursor Rules Enhancement**: We are implementing repository-wide improvements to the cursor rules system. Several tasks have been completed for this initiative:
   - Added version control for Cursor rules (Task ID: 2025-05-02-05) - In Progress
   - Created rule registry file (Task ID: 2025-05-02-07) - Completed
   - Completed metadata updates for remaining rules (Task ID: 2025-05-02-08) - Completed
   The status of this feature has been updated from "Not Started" to "In Progress" based on these completed tasks.

All plans have been created and are documented in the docs/plans/ directory. Multiple features are now actively in progress, with several completed tasks.

## Notes

- AI assistants should update this file after each significant change to maintain context
- The date in task IDs should be generated using `$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`
- **Before creating a new task document, always check the `docs/tasks/` directory for existing task files for the current date. Use the next available sequence number. Never overwrite an existing task file.**
- Completed tasks should be moved to a `docs/tasks/done/` directory
- Task status should be updated in this file and in the plan document
- When using knowledge graph MCP server, remember to sync memory files with graph entities
- All plan documents follow a consistent structure with phases, tasks, acceptance criteria, and maintenance considerations
- Rule development should follow the best practices identified in the cursor-rules-location rule and the research on Cursor rules
- The cursor-rule-cross-references rule defines the proper syntax for linking in Cursor rules, which is `[display text](mdc:path/to/file.ext)` for ALL file links
- All memory files should follow the templates defined in the memory-management rule
- Memory files now exist for workflow status, architecture, user preferences, domain knowledge, decisions, and task-specific issues (like eslint-typescript-markdown-issue)
- Memory files are now properly linked with cross-references for better navigation and context retention
- Task IDs must be unique - if duplicate IDs are discovered, they must be corrected immediately to maintain proper project tracking
